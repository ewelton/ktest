To meet the needs of reform of the telecommunication industry and liberalization of the telecommunication market, since April 1999, the Ministry of Information Industry (MII) has in succession approved the establishment of six working groups specialized in development of communications standards, i.e. CWTS, TNS, IPSG, NSSG, NMSG, and power supply standard working group, and China Mobile Internet Application Protocol Special Group (CMIS), as well as Communications Standard and Technology Coordination Department and Communications Standardization Promotion Centre.

To establish a nationwide unified communications standardization organization that is compatible with international norms and Chinese situations and capable of meeting the needs in the market, a number of senior experts, among them Mr. Wei Leping and Mr. Wu Hequan, proposed to establish China's communications standard organization on the basis of existing standard working groups.
