This can be aggregated with other information to build a model of you, your personality, your habits, etc.\n\n \"Bundled into VR headsets or AR glasses, eye-tracking will, in the near-future, enable companies to collect your intimate and unconscious responses to real-world cues and those they design. Those insights can be used entirely for your benefit. But they will also be seen as priceless inputs for ad-driven businesses, which will learn, model, predict and manipulate your behavior far beyond anything weâ€™ve seen to date.\\\" ([89], 2019)
