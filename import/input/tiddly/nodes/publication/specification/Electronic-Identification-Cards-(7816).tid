This part of ISO/IEC 7816 specifies the physical characteristics of integrated circuit(s) cards with contacts. It applies to identification cards of the ID-1 card type which may include embossing and/or a magnetic stripe as specified in ISO/IEC 7811, parts 1 to 6.
This part of ISO/IEC 7816 applies to cards which have a physical interface with electrical contacts. It does not, however, define the nature, number and position of the integrated circuits in the cards.
