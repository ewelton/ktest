CEF eSignature helps public administrations and businesses to accelerate the creation and verification of electronic signatures. The deployment of solutions based on this building block in a Member State facilitates the mutual recognition and cross-border interoperability of eSignatures, so that their legal value can be recognised in countries other than the country of origin of the signer.
