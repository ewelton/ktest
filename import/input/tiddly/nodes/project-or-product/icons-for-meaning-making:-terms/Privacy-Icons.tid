Here are the proposed icons. These are the result of a number of working groups convened by Aza Raskin. We are seeking to develop boilerplate legal text to back up each of the icons. The initial designs provided here are by Michael Nieling & Ocupop: designers of the official HTML5 logos. They are not yet final.
