The goal of the e-CODEX project is to:

“Improve the cross-border access of citizens and businesses to legal means in Europe as well as to improve the interoperability between legal authorities within the EU.”

What exactly does that mean? e-CODEX is a functionality which provides an easier (digital) way to exchange legal information between EU-countries. No more bureaucratic paperwork no matter the differences between the EU countries.

The aim of the project is:
* Contributing to the implementation of the EU legal framework and the e-Justice action plan, in due respect of subsidiarity
* Achieving interoperability between existing national judicial systems
* Enabling all Member States to work together towards a more effective judicial system in Europe
* Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the processing of the increasing number of cross-border proceedings, especially in civil, criminal and commercial matters
* Contributing to a safer environment for citizens inside the EU
* Modernizing the judicial systems in Europe
* Increasing collaboration and exchange between judicial systems of the Member 

In a nutshell:
* Easy and secure access to legal information and procedures in other EU Member States for businesses and citizens
* Greater cross-border effectiveness of legal processes through common standards and greater interoperability of information systems
* Improved efficiency of cross-border judicial processes through standards and solutions that ease and facilitate the cross-border case-handling activities

In a few words: Enabling access to justice systems across Europe.
