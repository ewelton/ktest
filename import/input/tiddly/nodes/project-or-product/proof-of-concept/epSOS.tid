epSOS aimed to design, build and evaluate a service infrastructure that demonstrates cross-border interoperability between electronic health record systems in Europe.

Cross-border eHealth Services
epSOS attempts to offer seamless healthcare to European citizens. Key goals are to improve the quality and safety of healthcare for citizens when travelling to another European country. Moreover, it concentrates on developing a practical eHealth framework and ICT infrastructure that enables secure access to patient health information among different European healthcare systems. epSOS can make a significant contribution to patient safety by reducing the frequency of medical errors and by providing quick access to documentation as well as by increasing acessibility of ones prescribed medicine also abroad. In emergency situations, this documentation  provides the medical personnel with life-saving information and reduces the (sometimes needless) repetition of diagnostic procedures.
The technical, legal and organizational concepts developed within the framework of the project are subject to an extensive practical testing phase which will last until the end of the project. epSOS will tests cross-border eHealth services in the following areas.
