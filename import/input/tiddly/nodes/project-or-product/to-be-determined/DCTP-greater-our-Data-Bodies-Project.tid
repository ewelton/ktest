DCTP is currently engaged in a local data justice campaign as part of a two year participatory national research project: called the “Our Data Bodies Project:” in collaboration with the New America Foundation and the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition.

The O.D.B. Project is a collaboration between academics and community-based organizations to explore the meaning and experience of privacy and data flows among poor and working class adults in three U.S. cities: Detroit: MI; Charlotte: NC; and Los Angeles: CA.
