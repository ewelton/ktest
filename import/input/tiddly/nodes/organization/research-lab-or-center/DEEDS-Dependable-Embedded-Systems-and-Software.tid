The DEEDS group conducts systems research focusing on "Trustworthiness" i.e., The provisioning of "Dependable & Secure" Distributed Middleware and Services. It has two emphasis areas of:

Design & Analysis: Exploration of Middleware (Software/OS/Protocols) issues in distributed and networked systems such as Data Centers, Storage and the Cloud infrastructure.
Assessment: Quantification of Trust (Security Metrics, Threat Profiling, SLAs) and Verification/Validation (experimental FI and formal model checking)
