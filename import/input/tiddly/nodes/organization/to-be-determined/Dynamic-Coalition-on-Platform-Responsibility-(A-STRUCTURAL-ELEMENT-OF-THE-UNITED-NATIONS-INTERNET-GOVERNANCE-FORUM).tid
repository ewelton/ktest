The establishment of the DC PR aims at fostering a cooperative multi-stakeholder effort in order to elaborate concrete and interoperable solutions to protect platform-usersâ€™ human rights. To that end, the involved stakeholders will interact via the DC PR mailing list in order to jointly delineate a set of model contractual-provisions, defined as Platform-User Protections (PUPs).
