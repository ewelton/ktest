Open Humans is a platform that allows you to upload: connect: and privately store your personal data – such as genetic: activity: or social media data. Once you've added data: you can choose to donate it: you might choose to share some publicly : and you can join and contribute to diverse research projects. Thus: we turn the traditional research pipeline on its head: you are at the center and in control of when you share your data. We want to empower you to explore your data – for example: enabling you to analyze your genome or your Twitter data.
