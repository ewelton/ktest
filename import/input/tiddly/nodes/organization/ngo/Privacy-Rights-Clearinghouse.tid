As a nonprofit organization protecting privacy for all by empowering individuals and advocating for positive change, we have focused exclusively on consumer privacy rights and issues since 1992. We strive to provide clarity on complex topics by publishing extensive educational materials and directly answering people’s questions. We also amplify the public’s voice—often underrepresented in policy discussions—in our work championing strong privacy protections.
