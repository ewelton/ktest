Digi.me and Personal  which merged in 2017 have been widely recognised since 2009 for pioneering individual control over data while enhancing privacy and security. Our distributed user-centric architecture shifts power to individuals by making it easy for people to aggregate their own data and privately share with apps and companies that play by these new rules.
