TrustSeed, a French software publishing company based in Paris, was established in 2002 as a leading provider of Internet security, able to guarantee the legal value of identities, signatures, and exchanges of digital documents. TrustSeed’s technology is based on 10 worldwide patents – relating to legal online signatures, extended traceability of transactions, and validation of legal issues- that apply to the new solutions of online services such as SaaS and Cloud computing. TrustSeed Package Software Publisher overcomes the four barriers of the Internet: (1) identity privacy and access management, (2) document content compliancy and legal online signature, (3) data transfer archiving and commuting, and (4) evidence value guarantee and interoperability. This reduces 70% operational costs and risks associated with online transactions. TrustSeed has built the first trustworthy ecosystem in SaaS and Cloud computing compliant with eTrust Services regulation (eIDAS) and NIS Directive.
