The Information Fiduciary Consortium will give incentives to companies to adopt more responsibility to protect user privacy. The consortiumâ€™s goal is to protect user data. In exchange for committing to fair security and privacy practices around user data collection, analysis, use, disclosure, and sale, companies will benefit from improved user trust.
