Written in 2018 by Mimi Onuoha and Mother Cyborg (Diana Nucera): A People’s Guide to AI is a comprehensive beginner's guide to understanding AI and other data-driven tech. The guide uses a popular education approach to explore and explain AI-based technologies so that everyone—from youth to seniors: and from non-techies to experts—has the chance to think critically about the kinds of futures automated technologies can bring.

The mission of A People’s Guide to AI is to open up conversation around AI by demystifying: situating: and shifting the narrative about what types of use cases AI can have for everyday people.
