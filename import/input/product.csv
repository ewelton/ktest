The Digital Standard,"The Digital Standard is an ambitious: open: and collaborative effort to create a digital privacy and security standard to help guide the future design of consumer software: digital platforms and services: and Internet-connected products.
The standard defines and reflects important consumer values that must be addressed in product development: electronics and software-based products should be secure: consumer information should be kept private: ownership rights of consumers should be maintained: and products should be designed to combat harassment and help protect freedom of expression.
Our goals are to enable consumer organizations to test: evaluate: and report on whether new products protect consumer security and privacy: and to empower consumers to make smarter choices about the products they buy.",https://www.thedigitalstandard.org/,,,,,,,,,Consumer Reports: Disconnect: Ranking Digital Rights: The Cyber Independent Testing Lab:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Datacommons.org,Publicly available data from open sources (census.gov: NOAA: data.gov: etc.) are vital resources for students and researchers in a variety of disciplines. Unfortunately: processing these datasets is often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying datasets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities (city: county: etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.,https://www.datacommons.org/,,,,,,,,,Google,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zynga's Privacyville,"Gamification of Privacy Terms. Website privacy policies: like their terms of use agreements: are onerously long: bafflingly complex legal documents that hundreds of millions of people accept without ever reading. As social media sites accrue more and more of our personal information while always developing new ways to exploit our data: they are increasingly targeted by hackers and law enforcement. In short: those long privacy statements: which we never read and which get longer all the time: matter more and more.

That’s why a trio of Yale students have developed a free service for websites called Privacy Simplified. Answer a few questions about your site and PS will generate a series of icons you can display to clearly explain the most important aspects of your privacy policy.",https://readwrite.com/2011/07/07/privacyville_zyngas_new_game_to_educate_users_abou/,Terms,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meaningful Consent,"Research grant at Southampton University UK.  

Consent increasingly underpins our digital activities - it underpins the legal contracts we “agree” to when using Social Networking Services and is an important concept in the new European Data Protection regulations.

But often the consent we give is meaningless! We tick the box without knowing what it means: or click the button just to get rid of the message. This poses problems for individuals who aren't aware of their rights and obligations: and for organisations that rely on this meaningless consent as a legal protection.",http://www.meaningfulconsent.org/,,,,,,,,,,Certification Candidate,M.C.
