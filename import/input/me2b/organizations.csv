Its flagship Identity Assurance Trust Framework programme in the US is also available in Europe, offering service providers conformity assessment and assurance against well known standards and specifications to assist procurers of those digital services and in turn their customers while also developing specifications from a ‘blank canvas’ to fill emerging industry and marketplace needs until formal standardization bodies can catch up. The best known of Kantara’s community developed, ground-breaking specifications include User Managed Access (EIC Award Winner for Innovation in Information Security 2014) is now being deployed in PSD2 environments and Healthcare globally while the Consent Receipt specification is being adopted in Financial Services across the world thanks to the collaboration with the US based industry association Financial Data Exchange (FDX).

Kantara Initiative Europe, together with its two other Kantara branded entities, connects a global, open, and transparent leadership community. It uses the artefacts, trademark and modified logotype of the Kantara Initiative, Inc USA by agreement from the US entity’s Board of Directors.

We’re working to bring all netizens – consumers, educational institutions, online businesses and governments alike – into the thriving marketplace for strong, secure online identity credentials. 

We’re doing this through the development of the Identity Ecosystem Framework (IDEF), a protective array of standards, best practices and agreements that all IDESG participants attest that they're in compliance with. What makes this different than any effort that’s come before is that it’s wholly grounded in the NSTIC Guiding Principles.

Datacommons.org,"Publicly available data from open sources (census.gov: NOAA: data.gov: etc.) are vital resources for students and researchers in a variety of disciplines. Unfortunately: processing these datasets is often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying datasets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities (city: county: etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.

Data Commons attempts to synthesize a single ""Open Knowledge Graph"" (OKG) from these different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such as cities: counties: organizations: etc.) across different datasets to nodes on the graph: so that users can access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. Like the Web: the Data Commons OKG is open - any user can contribute datasets or build applications powered by the graph. In the long term: we hope the data contained within the Data Commons OKG will be useful to students: researchers: and enthusiasts across different disciplines. Though we've ""jump-started"" the graph with data from publicly available sources (CDC: US Census: FBI: etc.): we encourage you to join and contribute.

You can use the Data Commons Graph Browser to browse the graph. The data can be programmatically accessed via APIs. For example usage: check out the tutorials.

Project VRM,"ProjectVRM is a development and research project of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. It has two purposes:

    To encourage development of tools by which individuals can take control of their relationships with organizations — especially in commercial marketplaces.
    To encourage and conduct research on VRM-related theories, usage of VRM tools, and effects as adoption of VRM tools takes place.

The project was created by Doc Searls when he became a fellow at the Center in 2006. Since then it has grown to play a driving role in many different development categories. (A partial and ever-changing list of those, and their occupants, is here.)

VRM stands for Vendor Relationship Management, the customer-side counterpart of Customer Relationship Management, the $48 billion business by which companies attempt to relate to customers (for example through call centers).

Doc sees VRM as “a way to fulfill one of the promises of The Cluetrain Manifiesto” — the widely-cited website and book written in 1999 by Doc and three other authors (one of which is David Weinberger, also of the Center). That promise was embodied in this statement, written by Christopher Locke:",https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/,research,academic,Consumer Support,outreach: publication,IOT,,,,Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://twitter.com/VRM,,,https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page

The Cyber Independent Testing Lab:,"The Main Question “How difficult is it for an attacker to find a new exploit for this software?”

Attackers have limited resources, and just like anyone else, they don't like to waste their time doing something the hard way if an easier path is available. They have tricks and heuristics they use to assess the relative difficulty to exploit software, so that they can focus on the easy targets and low hanging fruit. Mudge has had a long career of doing just that (legally, and for research purposes), so he's developed his own personal toolkit of measurements to take when assessing software risk. By consulting with other luminaries of the security field who have extensive exploit development experience, we've been able to build up the list of static analysis metrics and features which we currently assess.

Towards Effective Web Privacy Notice and Choice

Natural language privacy policies have become a de facto standard to address expectations of “notice and choice” on the Web. Yet, there is ample evidence that users generally do not read these policies and that those who occasionally do struggle to understand what they read. Initiatives aimed at addressing this problem through the development of machine implementable standards or other solutions that require website operators to adhere to more stringent requirements have run into obstacles, with many website operators showing reluctance to commit to anything more than what they currently do.",https://usableprivacy.org/,,,,,,,,,Usable Privacy Project,,,,Carnegie Mellon University: Fordham University: Stanford University: Center for Internet and Society: University of Cincinnati: Penn State: Columbia University: University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,National Science Foundation under its Secure and Trustworthy Computing initiative (CNS-1330596),,,,,,,
