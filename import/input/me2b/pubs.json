This report summarises and sysnthesises our discussions from those two days as a means of encouraging conversation and collaboration: and acting as a roadmap for the development of a digital economy that puts individuals in control. Five Pillars Five 'pillars' are crucial to the development of a consentful digital economy; developments are required in all five: and they reinforce (or weaken) one another.",

        "About": "The diversity problems of the AI industry and the issues of bias in AI systems tend to be considered separately. In this report we suggest that they are two sides of the same problem: issues of discrimination in the workforce and in system building are deeply related. Moreover: tackling the challenges of bias within technical systems requires addressing workforce diversity: and vice versa. Our research points to new ways of understanding the relationships between these complex problems: which can open up new pathways to redressing the current imbalances and harms.\nDrawing on a thorough review of existing literature and current research working on issues of gender: race: class: and artificial intelligence: this pilot study examines the scale of AI\u2019s current diversity crisis and possible paths forward. It represents the first stage of a multi-year project examining the intersection of gender: race and power in AI.",
