SCIM (RFC7644) is an IETF protocol that enables HTTP clients to retrieve and manage cross-domain identities. OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol which offers access to profile information through a UserInfo endpoint. This specification defines how OpenID Connect relying parties may discover availability of and register for, and access, SCIM services as part of an OpenID Provider (OP) services.
