ThingsCon is a global initiative to explore and promote the development of fair, responsible, and human-centric technologies for the IoT and beyond.

We organize events, and create resources and tools for a diverse community of practitioners to promote ethical, considerate, responsible and human-centric practices across IoT, artificial intelligence, machine learning and related technology with a human impact.

We help organizations of any size explore issues of agency, inclusivity, fairness, public good, responsibility, and openness in a world of technologically-driven complexity. See our Trustmark for IoT, the Trustable Technology Mark initiative.
