        "Description": "Algorithms are increasingly invoked as powerful entities that control, govern, sort, regulate, and shape everything from financial trades to news media. Nevertheless, the nature and implications of such orderings are far from clear. What exactly is it that algorithms \u201cdo\u201d? What is the role attributed to \u201calgorithms\u201d in these arguments? How can we turn the \u201cproblem of algorithms\u201d into an object of productive inquiry?\n\nThis conference sets out to explore the recent rise of algorithms as an object of interest in scholarship, policy, and practice. Taking a fresh view on the current wave of interest in the topic, we aim to discuss themes such as:\n\n    the very idea of \u201calgorithms\u201d as a subject and object of analysis\n    issues of methodology and the kind of knowledge claims that come with algorithms\n    the rhetoric of problems and solutions, in which algorithms are mobilized\n    questions of agency and automation\n    conceptions of secrecy or inscrutability\n    normative concerns\n    rules and regulations surrounding development and implementation\n\nThe conference is over now, but you can still sign up for the Mailing list and enjoy the various Resources we assembled.",

It is very much appreciated.\nNow, we must share with you the news that for several weeks the Peel family has been facing medical challenges, and it is now clear that dealing with this must be the priority for Deborah in the months to come. In order to support the Peels, we have made the difficult decision to cancel the Summit planned for January 28-29, 2019 at Georgetown Law Center, Washington, DC.\nWe will be back to you as soon as we have a clear path forward. In the meantime, we again say thank you and look forward to connecting and moving onward with our important mission to work together to protect the privacy rights of all patients.\nWe know that you share with us our best wishes for the Peel family,\nPatient Privacy Rights Board and Leadership",
