        "Description": "The OASIS COEL specification provides a privacy-by-design framework for the collection and processing of behavioural data. It is uniquely suited to the transparent use of dynamic data for personalised digital services, IoT applications where devices are collecting information about identifiable individuals and the coding of behavioural data in identity solutions. The specification pseudonymises personal data at source and maintains a separation of different data types with clearly defined roles & responsibilities for all actors. All behavioural data are defined as event-based packets. Every packet is connected directly to an individual and can contain a summary of the consent they provided for the processing of the data. A combination of a taxonomy of all human behaviours (the COEL model) and the event-based protocol provide a universal template for data portability. Simple interface specifications enforce the separation of roles and provide system-level interoperability.",

The scope of work includes a range of applications from access management to network resources to standalone transaction and identity management services. Such applications require a high degree of security, reliability and personalisation offered by modern SIM based platforms.\n\nThe SIM Working Group provides a forum for consensus building amongst all GSMA membership categories in relation to support and advice on the promotion, implementation and adoption of smart card technology and identity services. It also provides strategic guidance to GSMA projects on SIM matters and manages a programme of related activities, typically through sub-groups, set up for particular purposes.",

We focus on a verifiable credential (a set of claims) created by an issuer about a subject\u2014a person, group, or thing\u2014and seek solutions inclusive of approaches such as: self-sovereign identity; presentation of proofs by the bearer; data minimization; and centralized, federated, and decentralized registry and identity systems. Our tasks include drafting and incubating Internet specifications for further standardization and prototyping and testing reference implementations.",
