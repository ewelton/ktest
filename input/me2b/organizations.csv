Its flagship Identity Assurance Trust Framework programme in the US is also available in Europe, offering service providers conformity assessment and assurance against well known standards and specifications to assist procurers of those digital services and in turn their customers while also developing specifications from a ‘blank canvas’ to fill emerging industry and marketplace needs until formal standardization bodies can catch up. The best known of Kantara’s community developed, ground-breaking specifications include User Managed Access (EIC Award Winner for Innovation in Information Security 2014) is now being deployed in PSD2 environments and Healthcare globally while the Consent Receipt specification is being adopted in Financial Services across the world thanks to the collaboration with the US based industry association Financial Data Exchange (FDX).

We’re doing this through the development of the Identity Ecosystem Framework (IDEF), a protective array of standards, best practices and agreements that all IDESG participants attest that they're in compliance with.

Datacommons.org,"Publicly available data from open sources (census.gov: NOAA: data.gov: etc.) are vital resources for students and researchers in a variety of disciplines. Unfortunately: processing these datasets is often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying datasets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities (city: county: etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.

Data Commons attempts to synthesize a single ""Open Knowledge Graph"" (OKG) from these different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such as cities: counties: organizations: etc.) across different datasets to nodes on the graph: so that users can access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. Like the Web: the Data Commons OKG is open - any user can contribute datasets or build applications powered by the graph. In the long term: we hope the data contained within the Data Commons OKG will be useful to students: researchers: and enthusiasts across different disciplines. Though we've ""jump-started"" the graph with data from publicly available sources (CDC: US Census: FBI: etc.): we encourage you to join and contribute.

You can use the Data Commons Graph Browser to browse the graph. The data can be programmatically accessed via APIs. For example usage: check out the tutorials.

Project VRM,"ProjectVRM is a development and research project of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. It has two purposes:

    To encourage development of tools by which individuals can take control of their relationships with organizations — especially in commercial marketplaces.
    To encourage and conduct research on VRM-related theories, usage of VRM tools, and effects as adoption of VRM tools takes place.

The project was created by Doc Searls when he became a fellow at the Center in 2006. Since then it has grown to play a driving role in many different development categories. (A partial and ever-changing list of those, and their occupants, is here.)

VRM stands for Vendor Relationship Management, the customer-side counterpart of Customer Relationship Management, the $48 billion business by which companies attempt to relate to customers (for example through call centers).

Attackers have limited resources, and just like anyone else, they don't like to waste their time doing something the hard way if an easier path is available. They have tricks and heuristics they use to assess the relative difficulty to exploit software, so that they can focus on the easy targets and low hanging fruit. Mudge has had a long career of doing just that (legally, and for research purposes), so he's developed his own personal toolkit of measurements to take when assessing software risk. By consulting with other luminaries of the security field who have extensive exploit development experience, we've been able to build up the list of static analysis metrics and features which we currently assess.

"Governing Algorithms
				A conference on computation, automation, and control","Algorithms are increasingly invoked as powerful entities that control, govern, sort, regulate, and shape everything from financial trades to news media. Nevertheless, the nature and implications of such orderings are far from clear. What exactly is it that algorithms “do”? What is the role attributed to “algorithms” in these arguments? How can we turn the “problem of algorithms” into an object of productive inquiry?

This conference sets out to explore the recent rise of algorithms as an object of interest in scholarship, policy, and practice. Taking a fresh view on the current wave of interest in the topic, we aim to discuss themes such as:

    the very idea of “algorithms” as a subject and object of analysis
    issues of methodology and the kind of knowledge claims that come with algorithms
    the rhetoric of problems and solutions, in which algorithms are mobilized
    questions of agency and automation
    conceptions of secrecy or inscrutability
    normative concerns
    rules and regulations surrounding development and implementation

people.io,"A human's fundamental right to privacy is increasingly at odds with the eroding status quo of how people's information is collected and used by companies, small and large.

New digital product and services require an ever increasing amount of data from across a person's life in order to keep pace with the demands of digitally savvy consumers.

Often, these products and services require the collection and processing of highly personal data, driving individuals to fatigue in their attempts to control who has access to their data.

Similarly, given the complexity of data and new age intelligent systems, it is widely acknowledged that most consumers no longer have the ability to comprehend which of their data has been collected by a company, or how it could / will / has had a positive or negative impact on their life.

This diminishing level of control, increasing level of consumer fatigue and the abstraction of value have already manifested themselves through data leaks, instances of data misuse on a global scale and the rapid formation of a data oligopoly (Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google).

Launched in 2017, people.io seeks to redress this balance and create a global ecosystem in which individuals regain control over the access, use and value of their personal data; whilst also enabling the creation of data-centric products and services that put control at their heart.

Whilst not new in its mission, the approach taken by people.io follows a new direction and seeks to reward users for taking control through demonstrating the value and opportunity of control, not the fear and risk of lacking control; bucking the trend of companies that use a person's short term fear to drive the adoption of a specific technology or industry objective.

people.io launched a Beta app in February 2017, whereby users are rewarded for responding to questions, connecting data sources and engaging with branded content. After hitting the #1 spot on the iTunes UK trending chart, ranking #4 in Lifestyle (just behind Tinder) and launching a co-branded version of their app with Teléfonica Deutschland, a waiting list was implemented and the team reverted back to stealth mode while focussing on Phase Two of their global vision.

In late 2018, a number of major announcements will be made that re-introduce people.io - as part of an ecosystem of data-centric products designed to empower people while solving some of the fundamental challenges faced by major corporates in their ability to compete with the major tech companies.

To-date, people.io has received investment from a number of Europe’s most successful entrepreneurs, including Thomas Höegh (Founder of Lovefilm, Arts Alliance and Growth Street) and Nick Robertson (Founder of ASOS) in addition to the Founders Factory and Wayra Deutschland.

Datacoup is changing this asymmetric dynamic that exists around our personal data. The first and most important step is getting people compensated for the asset that they produce. We are building for a future where individuals like you are in control of your data and are the chief beneficiaries of its value.",https://datacoup.com,,,,,MyData Operator,,,,,,,,MyData,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Datum,"Abstract: The Datum network allows anyone to store structured data securely in
a decentralized way on a smart contract blockchain. The DAT smart token
enables optional selling and buying of stored data while enforcing data usage
rules as set by the data owner.
Every day we create 2.5 Quintillion bytes of data, and 90% of the world’s data today
has been created in the last 2 years alone. Data stored grows 4x faster than the
world economy and contributes to a substantial shift in economic power and
source of economic value.
A lot of this data is created by individuals or organizations; browsing the internet,
interacting on social networks, uploading personal files, syncing devices and
shopping online. This data is owned and stored by large private organizations in
huge data silos where it is susceptible to selling, tampering, extraction and other
exploitation. The originator of the data mostly loses control over its data when
signing up to various services such as Facebook, Google, Instagram, Snap, Twitter
etc., that offer ‘free’ services in exchange for exploitation of data, e.g. Google’s
Gmail service reading emails and showing targeted ads as a result.
Datum proposes a network run on a secure smart contract blockchain that allows
all of its users to retake control of their data, not just the personal and habitual
data they produce every day, but also data from the (IoT) devices that they control.

Datum encompasses the following key elements:
A fast decentralized data store allowing users to store structured data securely
running on a smart contract blockchain
The DAT token enabling this data storage and sharing
The data marketplace, enabling individuals to monetize their data on their terms
Datum leverages BigchainDB and IPFS to provide an infinitely scalable,
decentralized data storage backend.
Data storage and data sharing is paid for by the DAT token.",https://datum.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://datum.org/assets/Datum-WhitePaper.pdf
The Common Data Project," We're working to create a Common Datatrust.

The Common Data Project is committed to democratizing access to data through the creation of a ""datatrust,"" a new online service that allows sensitive data to be directly queried without compromising individual privacy. Through the datatrust, we hope to create a space for ""common data"" that allows sensitive data to be open and shared among researchers, policymakers, application developers, and the general public.

Sensitive Data: They have it, we don't.

Today, sensitive personal information is being collected from us by almost every business, organization and institution we interact with. However, we as the public have very little access to it. While businesses use our data to figure out what we'll buy, what we'll eat, and how much debt we'll pay back, the public sector has yet to harness the power of such data for itself. LEARN MORE

What should we do? Democratize access.

Some people see this is a problem of privacy. They've advocated giving users more control over how their data is shared, or argued for barring reuses of data.

But we see this as a problem of power and access. Privacy is definitely a central issue, which is why we've worked hard on developing a measurable privacy guarantee. But we think that by focusing only on radio controls or restricting reuse, we are risking the loss of innovation. The solution is not to shut down data collection, but to democratize access to data in a way that is safe and responsible through the creation of a datatrust.LEARN MORE ",http://www.commondataproject.org/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DECODE,"What is the problem?
DECODE is a response to people’s concerns about a loss of control over their personal information on the internet. The ability to access, control and use personal data has become a means by which internet companies can drive profits. 

The people who create much of this data have lost control over how it is used. This is a problem.

People have lost control of their data. This does not just mean the erosion of privacy and autonomy, it’s also bad for the security of people’s online identity
The huge quantities of data produced every day offers the potential for insights which could benefit all of society. With the data controlled by a handful of monopolies, this data is inaccessible to people and organisations who want to create solutions and services for public benefit
The monopolisation of data creates economic inefficiencies and inequalities. This threatens to undermine trust between citizens, public institutions, and companies, which is essential for a stable, sustainable and collaborative economy
The current digital ecosystem and Internet of Things (IoT) landscape is highly fragmented, with a multitude of non-interoperable vertical solutions, all offering their own set of devices, gateways and platforms, and means of data handling in data “silos”. This fragmentation makes data unmanageable and end users ultimately lose control over it.

How do we solve it?
We believe that people should have a choice about what happens to their digital identity, who uses their data online, and for which purposes.

DECODE is an experimental project to develop practical alternatives to how we use the internet today - four European pilots will show the wider social value that comes with individuals being given the power to take control of their personal data and given the means to share their data differently.

DECODE will explore how to build a data-centric digital economy where data that is generated and gathered by citizens, the Internet of Things (IoT), and sensor networks is available for broader communal use, with appropriate privacy protections.

As a result, innovators, startups, NGOs, cooperatives, and local communities can take advantage of that data to build apps and services that respond to their needs and those of the wider community.",https://decodeproject.eu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Enigma,"Enigma was created
to solve the privacy crisis.
The most difficult problems demand innovative solutions. Today, many of the world's biggest challenges arise from over-centralization. We believe that decentralized systems like Enigma can help us solve them.

When too-big-to-fail banks nearly destroyed the global economy in 2008, a decentralized digital currency - Bitcoin - was born in response. Now, an over-centralized internet and large tech monopolies have put our privacy, our security, and our society at risk. Enigma's solutions are part of the foundation for a decentralized, more secure, more sustainable internet - and a better world.",https://enigma.co/,,,,,,,,,MIT Media Lab,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

–Jerry Wiesner, Media Lab building dedication, 1986
True to Jerry’s vision, for over 30 years Media Lab researchers have anticipated and created technologies to make our lives safer, cleaner, healthier, fairer, and more productive. But along with benefits, technology’s everyday efficiencies have also brought their share of issues: obesity, poverty, ethical implications, bullying, divergent politics. The Media Lab’s interdisciplinary research community is uniquely equipped to address these concerns, leveraging the best that technology has to offer, and connecting technology back to the social and the human. Current Lab research examines the deeper implications of where technology creation and adoption has led us—and where we want to go next. ",https://www.media.mit.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mass Network,"Consumer disaffection with irrelevant and obtrusive ads has resulted in the rapid growth of ad-blocker adoption.This fact is making data-tracking nearly useless and threatens the entire online advertising business model as a result. The industry’s current solution is an arms race of anti-blockers versus anti-anti-blockers and in some cases alliances with the ad-blockers, themselves. This inefficient counter-productivity inevitably leads to a dead-end. To solve this problem, ad industry and Blockchain experts have combined efforts to create The Mass Network—a Blockchain-based solution aimed at fixing the imbalance of power between the online advertising industry and internet users who unwittingly provide the ad machine its revenue source: data. The Mass proposition is to exchange this wasteful battle for a mutually beneficial, proactive commerce by creating a Blockchain-based marketplace for consumers, webmasters, and data management platforms. Here, the industry pays a fair, market-determined rate to users for their data and attention. This voluntarily provided user information exchanged for compensation presents truly valuable data to the industry when compared to the current ill-gotten and often misinterpreted data harvested at present. To power this network and to create a stable method of exchange Mass will release Mass Coin to the public via a one-time only offering. Once live, average internet users within the system will be paid Mass Coin in exchange for their attention. Mass Coin lives on the Blockchain. It has the same transparency, fluidity, and security of Bitcoin without the dramatic price volatility. Mass paves a way to the monetization of our everyday online experience while improving consumers’ attitudes toward brands, publishers and making advertising more efficient to the benefit of all parties involved. In a world where people's lives are becoming more and more digitized Mass provides a safeguard from exploitation by improving access, integrity, and trust.
