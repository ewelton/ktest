Customer Commons also holds that an individual must be able to proffer his or her own terms of engagement, in ways that are practical and easy to understand by both sides—and to agree to, in ways that can be visited and audited later.

Our research challenges to address this gap are interdisciplinary: meaningful consent has implications for transforming current digital economy data practices; change will require potentially new business models, and certainly new forms of interaction to highlight policy without over burdening citizens as we go about our business. We have set out a vision to achieve an understanding of meaningful consent through a combination of interdisciplinary expert and citizen activities to deliver useful policy, business and technology guidelines.

Privacy Icons,"The problem: users need to know how companies intend to use their data—but privacy policies and terms of service are long-winded, complex documents that encapsulate a lot of situation-specific detail.

The solution: a set of Privacy Icons to “bolt on to” your existing privacy policy. When you add a Privacy Icon to your privacy policy, you’re essentially saying: “No matter what the rest of this privacy policy says, the following is true and preempts anything else in this document.”

Each Privacy Icon makes an iron-clad guarantee about what a company will do with a user’s data. Now, people can understand how their personal data will be transacted, with just a glance. At the same time, companies retain the flexibility needed to create comprehensive, detailed, and meaningful policies.

Privacy Icons are legal declarations, written in cooperation with privacy experts and a coalition of industry stakeholders. And soon, they will be machine readable—enabling users to communicate their preferences through trusted agents (like web browsers).

IoT Trust Framework,"The IoT Trust Framework® includes a set of strategic principles necessary to help secure IoT devices and their data when shipped and throughout their entire life-cycle. Through a consensus driven multi-stakeholder process, criteria have been identified for connected home, office and wearable technologies including toys, activity trackers and fitness devices. The Framework outlines the need for comprehensive disclosures which need to be provided prior to product purchase, policies regarding data collection, usage and sharing, as well as the terms and conditions of security patching post-warranty. Security updates are essential to maximize the protection of IoT devices when vulnerabilities are discovered and attacks evolve. In addition, the Framework provides recommendations for manufacturers to enhance transparency and communication regarding devices’ ability to be updated and a range of data privacy related issues.

Core to addressing the inherent security risks and privacy issues is the application of the principles to the entire device solution or ecosystem. These include the device or sensor, the supporting applications, and the backend / cloud services. As many products coming to market rely on third-party or open source components and software, it is incumbent on developers to apply these principles and conduct supply chain security and privacy risk assessments.

Serving as a risk assessment guide for developers, purchasers and retailers, the Framework is the foundation for future IoT certification programs. It is the goal of OTA to highlight devices which meet these standards to help consumers, as well as the public and private sectors, make informed purchasing decisions. The Framework and related resources are available at https://otalliance.org/IoT.",https://www.internetsociety.org/iot/trust-framework/,service: terms,,certification and compliance: transparency and accountability: governance,,,,IOT,,Internet Society: Online Trust Alliance,,Steve Olshansky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2018/iot-trust-by-design

Data & Society Research ,"Research at Data & Society is shaped by cross-cutting themes:

    How do we understand and combat vulnerabilities in socio-technical systems?
    Can we use a rights-based framework to guide the development of artificial intelligence?
    How do we facilitate ethical design and effective regulations as human labor meets intelligent systems?

Vulnerabilities in socio-technical systems

While calls for greater accountability mechanisms within socio-technical systems are widespread, these systems are increasingly subject to manipulation, such as from biased data that infuse algorithmic models. These conditions require an assessment of strategic manipulation, a broad imagination about the possibilities for encoding fairness and accountability into technical systems, and deep ethnographic research that describes and understands new social activity.

Algorithms and Publics,"There is a recognizable value in democratic societies in having mechanisms by which the public can come together to discuss the issues of the day, to identify problems, and propose solutions. Historically, the news media – print, radio, and television – has provided the spaces where competing narratives are publicly debated. Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.

Can Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.

This project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry. In addition, this project mapped existing concerns and research already underway in this field and enlisted the advice and aid of a group of scholars who were engaged in this area.",https://datasociety.net/algorithms-and-publics/,research,,,,"Media Manipulation: Data & Society Research: Publications, Parent",,analytics,,Data & Society Research Institute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding Privacy as a Means of Economic Redistribution,"Data & Society 2015-2016 Fellow Karen Levy and Affiliate Solon Barocas investigated how low-SES populations understand and appeal to privacy in order to protect their economic interests in low-wage labor markets. In the low-wage workplace, novel forms of data collection and analysis can operate to entrench inequality and limit workers’ economic power. This project examined how the working poor mobilize privacy to shape information flows, in an effort to limit these negative redistributive effects.

The project assessed these practices in three work contexts: the impacts of agricultural data collection on small farmers; the use of data-intensive scheduling systems for retail management; and the use of low-wage labor to train production-process robotic systems.",https://datasociety.net/initiatives/future-of-labor/privacy-economic-redistribution/,,,,,Social Instabilities in Labor Futures: Data & Society Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mapping Inequalities Across the On-Demand Economy,"Narratives around the on-demand economy have often elided key differences in how the same policies, technologies, and practices can have contrasting effects on different workers’ experiences on the ground, both within and across sectors. As on-demand business models bring practices like algorithmic management and on-demand scheduling into new areas of work, these same practices may both empower and adversely affect workers in unanticipated ways.

Through multi-sited ethnographic research, this project examines the experiences of workers on labor platforms and serves to build a foundation for engagement with a wide variety of stakeholders in future research and to project viable pathways of policy intervention.

The fieldwork for this project targets what is at stake for workers across two segments of the on-demand economy: care and cleaning industry and ridehailing services, such as Uber and Lyft.

Supporting Ethics in Data Research,"New and complex data sets raise challenging ethical questions about risk to individuals that are not sufficiently covered by computer science training, ethics codes, or Institutional Review Boards. The use of publicly available, corporate, and government datasets may reveal human practices, behaviors, and interactions in unintended ways, creating the need for new kinds of ethical support. This project examined the role of research librarians in assisting computer science researchers as they navigate emerging issues of privacy, ethics, and equitable access to data at different phases of the research process.

This exploratory project built upon the emerging support systems, including assistance from the research library, for computer science researchers that has resulted from Data Management Plans required by federal funders. Drawing on their data management skills and knowledge of information ethics, academic librarians may be well poised to act as partners to computer science and engineering researchers throughout the research process, including the use of third-party data.

This project was supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Dr. Rachelle Hollander, Director for the Center for Engineering, Ethics, and Society at the National Academy of Engineering, served as a project advisor.
