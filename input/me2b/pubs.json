In this report we suggest that they are two sides of the same problem: issues of discrimination in the workforce and in system building are deeply related. Moreover: tackling the challenges of bias within technical systems requires addressing workforce diversity: and vice versa. Our research points to new ways of understanding the relationships between these complex problems: which can open up new pathways to redressing the current imbalances and harms.\nDrawing on a thorough review of existing literature and current research working on issues of gender: race: class: and artificial intelligence: this pilot study examines the scale of AI\u2019s current diversity crisis and possible paths forward.

        "About": "People live with all kinds of digital objects. These range from social networks to cutting-edge connected objects. They are now a fully-fledged part of our aesthetic relationship with the world, on a par with architecture or decorative art. A certain widely distributed and highly standardised aesthetic of digital media has been created, producing strong brands in users\u2019 minds. Users are barely aware of this aesthetic, which is well thought out. Conditioning through design pre-empts everything that the individual handles or sees in the digital world.In the wake of Bauhaus, where design is based on the search for functional aesthetics, digital technology has become a relevant field of application in problem-solving. For, beyond the desire to avoid ugliness that \u201cdoes not sell\u201d, to quote Raymond Loewy, the digital promise is so broad that the functions provided by design seem endless, giving the key players that own them the expectation of a substantial return on investment.Web giants have understood this by competing to attract users, customising their experience, influencing \u2013 as subtly and as substantially as possible \u2013 their behaviour, in all fields, from leisure to politics. They stand as a compass to navi-gate the abundance of content and the anxiety of the non-optimisation of time.But this model is no longer followed. Maybe because it seems to \u201ctake advantage\u201d of individuals, their \u201cmalleability\u201d and tendency to become accustomed to simplicity. Concerns regarding personal data are a strong signal of the discomfort felt by users themselves.In this regard, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a major response and a first essential milestone towards greater transparency and a reaction to the crisis of confidence. It offers regulators several legal and technical instruments to make users the focal point of the data economy.But, to fight the model of individuals who are \u201cobjects of technology\u201d, design can act as a rampart and deploy its firepower.The aim is not only to make objects beautiful but to propose an aesthetic to support another digital project. This project is not simply functional but humanistic, targeting sustainable goals that users can master; a project more imbued with common sense regarding the real needs of users taken in all their complexity.Prosaically, the aim is not to be deceived, to fully consent to the effort that companies want to relieve us of and ultimately say \u201cyes\u201d together. To do that, in practical terms, the interface is far from cosmetic.Design then reaches its full meaning, that of aesthetics to support humanity. It is beautiful as it is rooted in that humanity.This publication therefore aims to project some ideas to build this digital aesthetic. It addresses the entire digital ecosystem by giving some operational recommendations to strengthen the control and choice to which users are entitled. The CNIL intends to participate in this and considers the attention taken with design solutions as a poten-tial framework on which to build its legal and technical expertise and better fulfil its mission to protect freedoms.",

Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) are one of the ways in which such adequate safeguards (Art. 47) may be demonstrated by a group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity.\n\nAccording to Article 64 GDPR, the use of BCRs as appropriate safeguards for international data transfers from the EEA requires the approval of the competent supervisory authority in accordance with the consistency mechanism set out in Article 63 without requiring any specific authorisation from a supervisory authority (Article 46.2.b GDPR). The following form is for use by companies seeking approval of BCRs. The form is based on papers previously issued by the Article 29 Working Party of European data protection authorities (the \"Working Party\"), and in particular WP133, and it is intended to help applicants demonstrate how to meet the requirements set out in Article 47 GDPR and WP 256.",

Some foresee the massive destruction of our jobs, the apocalyptic emergence of a hostile robotic consciousness or the downfall of Europe, called to get overwhelmed by the global competition. Others, meanwhile, are being pinned on the dream of a tailor-made world, a new Golden Age where every thankless or repetitive task would be  delegated  to  machines;  an  Eden  where  infallible  tools would have put an end to illness and crime, and perhaps even political conflict; in short, evil would have become a thing of the past. Under its myriad guises that are, by turn, fascinating or alarming, bright or gloomy, AI arguably says more about our fantasies and fears than about what our future world will look like. The appeal of this type of eschatological rhetoric in Europe is such that it shows to what extent technology allows visions of the future and generates a power to look ahead, which is sometimes lacking from our political visions.",

In   other   words, a   DPIA   is   a   process   for   building   and demonstrating compliance.Under  the  GDPR, non-compliance  with  DPIA  requirements  can  lead  to  fines  imposed  by  the competent supervisory authority.Failure to carry out a DPIA when the processing is subject to a DPIA(Article 35(1) and (3)-(4)), carrying out a DPIA in an incorrect way(Article 35(2) and (7) to (9)), or failing to consult the competent supervisory authority where required(Article 36(3)(e)),can result in an  administrativefine of up  to  10M\u20ac,  or  in  the  case  of  an  undertaking,  up  to  2  %  of  the  total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.",

The concept of consent as used in the Data Protection  Directive  (hereafter:  Directive  95/46/EC)  and  in  the  e-Privacy  Directive  to  date,  has  evolved. The GDPR provides  further  clarification  and  specification  of  the  requirements  for obtaining  and  demonstrating  valid  consent.

The  obligation  is  on  controllers  to  innovate  to  find  new  solutions  that  operate  within  the  parameters of  the  law  and  better  support  the  protection  of  personal  data  and  the  interests  of  data  subjects.Consent remains  one  of  six  lawful  bases to  process  personal  data,  as  listed  in Article 6  of  the  GDPR.1 When initiating activities that involve processing of personal data, a controller must always take time to consider what would be the appropriate lawful ground for the envisaged processing.",

Transparency is an overarching obligation under the GDPR applying to three central areas: (1) the provision of   information   to   data   subjects   related   to   fair   processing;   (2)   how   data   controllers communicate with data subjects in relation to their rights under the GDPR; and (3) how data controllers facilitate the exercise by data subjects of their rights2. Insofar as compliance with transparency is required in relation to data processing under Directive (EU) 2016/6803, these guidelines  also  apply  to  the  interpretation  of  that  principle.4These  guidelinesare,  like  all WP29 guidelines, intended to be generallyapplicable and relevantto controllersirrespective of the sectoral, industry or regulatory specifications particularto any given data controller. Assuch,these guidelines cannot address the nuances and many variables which may arise in the  context  of  the  transparency obligations of  a specificsector, industry or  regulated area. However,these guidelines are intended to enable controllers to understand,at a high level, WP29\u2019s interpretation of what the transparency obligations entail in practice andto indicatethe  approach  which  WP29  considers  controllers  should  take to  being  transparent  while embedding fairnessand accountability into theirtransparency measures.",

        "About": "Some one billion people in the developing world lack proof of legal identity. Living without proof of legal identity is a serious obstacle to social, economic, and political inclusion. It also makes it difficult for an individual to open a bank account, vote, obtain formal employment, access education or healthcare, receive a social transfer, buy a SIM card, or seek legal redress. Furthermore, a person without identification may be unable to exercise the full range of human rights set out in international laws and conventions. Weak civil identification systems also represent challenges for countries such as governance planning, service delivery, public sector administration, collecting taxes, border control and emergency response. As public and private service providers increasingly transition into the digital realm, the ability for individuals to prove who they are will be essential for accessing benefits and services via digital platforms. This move toward digital platforms can increase efficiency of service delivery, create significant savings for citizens, governments, and businesses by reducing transaction costs, as well as drive innovation. This can generate many benefits, but can also exacerbate the risk of isolation for poorly-connected populations including rural and remote communities, the forcibly displaced, stateless persons and other marginalized groups. Leveling the playing field requires a coordinated, sustained effort by countries as well as stakeholders involved in the provision and use of identification systems. A shared vision through this set of common Principles can contribute to robust and universal identification systems that in turn promote social and economic inclusion and sustainable development outcomes.

The White Paper is a collaboration of more than 50 organizations (big corporations, startups, politics, academics, NGOs, etc.) from 14 countries.\n\nA new digital society (p. 6)\n\nWe believe that personal data is one of the most essential societal issues of the XXIst century. Personal data is not solely about technology as it encompasses also legal, design, social and economic issues. At the same time, in a technological world, technological standards are key as they shape actual practices, so there is a need to ensure that the values we want to prevail in our society are well embedded in the technologies we create and use every day. We want a responsible and ethical digital society that benefits people, businesses and society. \n\nA fair and efficient digital society requires personal data to flow freely under the strict control of individuals themselves. It is perfectly aligned with the EU Digital Single Market strategy. As the importance of personal data in society continues to expand, it becomes increasingly urgent to make sure individuals are in a position to control their personal data, but also to gain personal knowledge from them and to claim their share of benefits. Healthcare, smart cities, environmental protection count among the many examples of tomorrow\u2019s challenges requiring an optimal circulation of data between organizations and, at the same time, a use that is well understood, accepted and most of all put under the control of individuals.",

        "About": "The first United Nations World Data Forum (UNWDF) took place in Cape Town, South Africa, in January 2017. At that Forum, the foundations were laid for a new joint endeavour to explore opportunities and identify good practices for enhancing data interoperability in the area of sustainable development.\n\nThese aims are today embodied in the Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability, established in March 2017 at a side-event to the 48th UN Statistical Commission and convened by the UN Statistical Division (UNSD) and Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD).\n\nAt the Data for Development Festival in Bristol in March 2017, the Collaborative agreed to produce guidance on data interoperability for development practitioners. This resulted in the launching in October 2018, at the second UN World Data Forum taking place in Dubai, of the first version of a document entitled \"Data interoperability: A practitioner's guide to joining up data in the development sector\". \n\nThe Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability will continue to build and maintain the Guide in this electronic space as it develops as a tool, adding new modules and examples as well as ancillary materials to help raise awareness of its existence and usability.\n\nIt is hoped that new synergies will form between data producers, publishers, users, and those providing capacity building and training. In this way, the guidance set out within the Guide can be incorporated into existing training materials and modules, and a consistent approach to the system-wide improvement of data interoperability can start to become a reality in the development sector.",

        "About": "In recent years, developments in genomics technologies have led to the rise of commercial personal genome testing (PGT): broad genome-wide testing for multiple diseases simultaneously. While some commercial providers require physicians to order a personal genome test, others can be accessed directly. All providers advertise directly to consumers and offer genetic risk information about dozens of diseases in one single purchase. The quantity and the complexity of risk information pose challenges to adequate pre-test and post-test information provision and informed consent. There are currently no guidelines for what should constitute informed consent in PGT or how adequate informed consent can be achieved. In this paper, we propose a tiered-layered-staged model for informed consent. First, the proposed model is tiered as it offers choices between categories of diseases that are associated with distinct ethical, personal or societal issues. Second, the model distinguishes layers of information with a first layer offering minimal, indispensable information that is material to all consumers, and additional layers offering more detailed information made available upon request. Finally, the model stages informed consent as a process by feeding information to consumers in each subsequent stage of the process of undergoing a test, and by accommodating renewed consent for test result updates, resulting from the ongoing development of the science underlying PGT. A tiered-layered-staged model for informed consent with a focus on the consumer perspective can help overcome the ethical problems of information provision and informed consent in direct-to-consumer PGT.",

These patterns are used to predict our behaviours but are not visible to us as individuals.\n\nA hypothetical financial institution, MiBank Direct PLC, has deep understanding of how current spending behaviour maps to future financial status for their internal risk management processes. They decide to generate new data structures that show customers\u2019 interactions without the financial details.\n\nThese are used to provide innovative consumer-centric services, developing a dialogue where customers can see how their behaviours compare to others and contribute to different financial outcomes.",

We outline this mismatch with five \u201ctraps\u201d that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.\u201d",

        "About": "2016, the CNIL adopted a three-year strategic and operational plan with two main goals. First to make the CNIL \u2013 which was faced with major quantitative and qualitative pressure due to far-reaching changes in a society entering the digital age \u2013 as an agile, comprehensive regulator   committed to joint regulation and inter-regulation. Secondly to create a project to cover an unprecedented period in the Commission\u2019s history: the years in which the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted and came into force.   Three years later, the vision put forward has proved pertinent: thanks to the ongoing commitment of all its teams, the CNIL is extensively repositioned  and  modernised. The strategic plan enabled a better preparation to tackle its missions and carry them out to good effect over the course of 2018, a remarkable year due  to  the  switchover  to  a  new  legal  framework, a new, largely Europeanised mode of personal data governance, and a consequent considerable increase in referrals to the CNIL from private individuals and professionals alike.   Major steps have also been taken in 2019. The new legal framework is now in place and European cooperation has become a reality. Nonetheless, there is still some way to go to complete the transformation and to live by a fully disseminated \u201cinformation technology and civil liberties\u201d culture all over the country. It is in this context that, in March 2019, the CNIL committed to fresh orientations covering the period 2019-2021. It chose to do so via a progressive, collaborative procedure, involving the Commission\u2019s members, managers and staff, who previously got together in crosscutting workshops to gather collective thought and build final orientations.This strategic roadmap for 2019-2021 sets the priorities for the years to come in order for the CNIL to carry out its public service mission with regards to itsvarious audiences\u2019 expectations, and taking into account both the resources available and the European collective\u2019s requirements.   Following a phase marked by changes and transitions, this roadmap\u2019scommon  thread is appropriation and  achievement, for one and all (private individuals,  professionals  and  the  European  collective  alike),of  all  the  GDPR\u2019s  promises and  potentialitie s.  The  2019-2021 period will  be  decisive  in  lending credibility to the new legal framework and in making the ambitious European challenge an operational success. Civil society and economic players have high expectations. The new model helps raise awareness and lays the groundwork for designing regulatory frameworks across the world. In order to remain an efficient and down-to-earth data regulator in this new context and play its role to the full at national and European level alike, the CNIL must test out theories in practice and continue to modernise. Consequently, it has identifiedfive strategic focuses to guide its action up to 2021.",
