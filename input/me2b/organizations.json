Unfortunately: processing these datasets is often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying datasets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities (city: county: etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.\n\nData Commons attempts to synthesize a single \"Open Knowledge Graph\" (OKG) from these different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such as cities: counties: organizations: etc.) across different datasets to nodes on the graph: so that users can access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. Like the Web: the Data Commons OKG is open - any user can contribute datasets or build applications powered by the graph. In the long term: we hope the data contained within the Data Commons OKG will be useful to students: researchers: and enthusiasts across different disciplines. Though we've \"jump-started\" the graph with data from publicly available sources (CDC: US Census: FBI: etc.): we encourage you to join and contribute.\n\nYou can use the Data Commons Graph Browser to browse the graph. The data can be programmatically accessed via APIs. For example usage: check out the tutorials.\n\nData Commons is a project started by Google: and is intended to be a community effort.

Among the technical metabolism, that is, new divices, new representation techniques arising every year based on that interest, we strongly recognize the importance of a persistence layer mainly responsible for memory, in other words, an IT that keeps stablly existing throught individual human lifecycle. What is called PDS today is very close to this. And it had better be implemented in the abstracted layer 'Cloud' or Web API (as opposed to 'Client'), which is relatively free from the metabolism. Such IT for the human society, should not be put under the control of single corporate or individual, but be shared and co-created using the knowledge of many individual or corporate entities.

After hitting the #1 spot on the iTunes UK trending chart, ranking #4 in Lifestyle (just behind Tinder) and launching a co-branded version of their app with Tel\u00e9fonica Deutschland, a waiting list was implemented and the team reverted back to stealth mode while focussing on Phase Two of their global vision.\n\nIn late 2018, a number of major announcements will be made that re-introduce people.io - as part of an ecosystem of data-centric products designed to empower people while solving some of the fundamental challenges faced by major corporates in their ability to compete with the major tech companies.\n\nTo-date, people.io has received investment from a number of Europe\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs, including Thomas H\u00f6egh (Founder of Lovefilm, Arts Alliance and Growth Street) and Nick Robertson (Founder of ASOS) in addition to the Founders Factory and Wayra Deutschland.",

        "About": "Abstract: The Datum network allows anyone to store structured data securely in\na decentralized way on a smart contract blockchain. The DAT smart token\nenables optional selling and buying of stored data while enforcing data usage\nrules as set by the data owner.\nEvery day we create 2.5 Quintillion bytes of data, and 90% of the world\u2019s data today\nhas been created in the last 2 years alone. Data stored grows 4x faster than the\nworld economy and contributes to a substantial shift in economic power and\nsource of economic value.\nA lot of this data is created by individuals or organizations; browsing the internet,\ninteracting on social networks, uploading personal files, syncing devices and\nshopping online. This data is owned and stored by large private organizations in\nhuge data silos where it is susceptible to selling, tampering, extraction and other\nexploitation. The originator of the data mostly loses control over its data when\nsigning up to various services such as Facebook, Google, Instagram, Snap, Twitter\netc., that offer \u2018free\u2019 services in exchange for exploitation of data, e.g. Google\u2019s\nGmail service reading emails and showing targeted ads as a result.\nDatum proposes a network run on a secure smart contract blockchain that allows\nall of its users to retake control of their data, not just the personal and habitual\ndata they produce every day, but also data from the (IoT) devices that they control.\n1\nDatum encompasses the following key elements:\nA fast decentralized data store allowing users to store structured data securely\nrunning on a smart contract blockchain\nThe DAT token enabling this data storage and sharing\nThe data marketplace, enabling individuals to monetize their data on their terms\nDatum leverages BigchainDB and IPFS to provide an infinitely scalable,\ndecentralized data storage backend.\nData storage and data sharing is paid for by the DAT token.",

        "About": " We're working to create a Common Datatrust.\n\nThe Common Data Project is committed to democratizing access to data through the creation of a \"datatrust,\" a new online service that allows sensitive data to be directly queried without compromising individual privacy. Through the datatrust, we hope to create a space for \"common data\" that allows sensitive data to be open and shared among researchers, policymakers, application developers, and the general public.\n\nSensitive Data: They have it, we don't.\n\nToday, sensitive personal information is being collected from us by almost every business, organization and institution we interact with. However, we as the public have very little access to it. While businesses use our data to figure out what we'll buy, what we'll eat, and how much debt we'll pay back, the public sector has yet to harness the power of such data for itself. LEARN MORE\n\nWhat should we do? Democratize access.\n\nSome people see this is a problem of privacy. They've advocated giving users more control over how their data is shared, or argued for barring reuses of data.\n\nBut we see this as a problem of power and access. Privacy is definitely a central issue, which is why we've worked hard on developing a measurable privacy guarantee. But we think that by focusing only on radio controls or restricting reuse, we are risking the loss of innovation. The solution is not to shut down data collection, but to democratize access to data in a way that is safe and responsible through the creation of a datatrust.LEARN MORE",

        "About": "What is the problem?\nDECODE is a response to people\u2019s concerns about a loss of control over their personal information on the internet. The ability to access, control and use personal data has become a means by which internet companies can drive profits. \n\nThe people who create much of this data have lost control over how it is used. This is a problem.\n\nPeople have lost control of their data. This does not just mean the erosion of privacy and autonomy, it\u2019s also bad for the security of people\u2019s online identity\nThe huge quantities of data produced every day offers the potential for insights which could benefit all of society. With the data controlled by a handful of monopolies, this data is inaccessible to people and organisations who want to create solutions and services for public benefit\nThe monopolisation of data creates economic inefficiencies and inequalities. This threatens to undermine trust between citizens, public institutions, and companies, which is essential for a stable, sustainable and collaborative economy\nThe current digital ecosystem and Internet of Things (IoT) landscape is highly fragmented, with a multitude of non-interoperable vertical solutions, all offering their own set of devices, gateways and platforms, and means of data handling in data \u201csilos\u201d. This fragmentation makes data unmanageable and end users ultimately lose control over it.\n\nHow do we solve it?\nWe believe that people should have a choice about what happens to their digital identity, who uses their data online, and for which purposes.\n\nDECODE is an experimental project to develop practical alternatives to how we use the internet today - four European pilots will show the wider social value that comes with individuals being given the power to take control of their personal data and given the means to share their data differently.\n\nDECODE will explore how to build a data-centric digital economy where data that is generated and gathered by citizens, the Internet of Things (IoT), and sensor networks is available for broader communal use, with appropriate privacy protections.\n\nAs a result, innovators, startups, NGOs, cooperatives, and local communities can take advantage of that data to build apps and services that respond to their needs and those of the wider community.",

Today, many of the world's biggest challenges arise from over-centralization. We believe that decentralized systems like Enigma can help us solve them.\n\nWhen too-big-to-fail banks nearly destroyed the global economy in 2008, a decentralized digital currency - Bitcoin - was born in response.

        "About": "Consumer disaffection with irrelevant and obtrusive ads has resulted in the rapid growth of ad-blocker adoption.This fact is making data-tracking nearly useless and threatens the entire online advertising business model as a result. The industry\u2019s current solution is an arms race of anti-blockers versus anti-anti-blockers and in some cases alliances with the ad-blockers, themselves. This inefficient counter-productivity inevitably leads to a dead-end. To solve this problem, ad industry and Blockchain experts have combined efforts to create The Mass Network\u2014a Blockchain-based solution aimed at fixing the imbalance of power between the online advertising industry and internet users who unwittingly provide the ad machine its revenue source: data. The Mass proposition is to exchange this wasteful battle for a mutually beneficial, proactive commerce by creating a Blockchain-based marketplace for consumers, webmasters, and data management platforms. Here, the industry pays a fair, market-determined rate to users for their data and attention. This voluntarily provided user information exchanged for compensation presents truly valuable data to the industry when compared to the current ill-gotten and often misinterpreted data harvested at present. To power this network and to create a stable method of exchange Mass will release Mass Coin to the public via a one-time only offering. Once live, average internet users within the system will be paid Mass Coin in exchange for their attention. Mass Coin lives on the Blockchain. It has the same transparency, fluidity, and security of Bitcoin without the dramatic price volatility. Mass paves a way to the monetization of our everyday online experience while improving consumers\u2019 attitudes toward brands, publishers and making advertising more efficient to the benefit of all parties involved. In a world where people's lives are becoming more and more digitized Mass provides a safeguard from exploitation by improving access, integrity, and trust.",
