Creative Common licensing terms,"The Creative Commons staff, board, and community identified several goals for the 4.0 license suite, tied to achieving CC's goals and mission. These include:

    Internationalization – further adapt the core suite of international licenses to operate globally, ensuring they are robust, enforceable and easily adopted worldwide;

    Interoperability – maximize interoperability between CC licenses and other licenses to reduce friction within the commons, promote standards and stem license proliferation;

    Long-lasting — anticipate new and changing adoption opportunities and legal challenges, allowing the new suite of licenses to endure for the foreseeable future;

    Data/PSI/Science/Education — recognize and address impediments to adoption of CC by governments as well as other important, publicly-minded institutions in these and other critical arenas; and

    Supporting Existing Adoption Models and Frameworks – remain mindful of and accommodate the needs of our existing community of adopters leveraging pre-4.0 licenses, including governments but also other important constituencies.

"DISCRIMINATING SYSTEMS - Gender, Race, and Power in AI","The diversity problems of the AI industry and the issues of bias in AI systems tend to be considered separately. In this report we suggest that they are two sides of the same problem: issues of discrimination in the workforce and in system building are deeply related. Moreover: tackling the challenges of bias within technical systems requires addressing workforce diversity: and vice versa. Our research points to new ways of understanding the relationships between these complex problems: which can open up new pathways to redressing the current imbalances and harms.
Drawing on a thorough review of existing literature and current research working on issues of gender: race: class: and artificial intelligence: this pilot study examines the scale of AI’s current diversity crisis and possible paths forward. It represents the first stage of a multi-year project examining the intersection of gender: race and power in AI.",https://ainowinstitute.org/discriminatingsystems.pdf,report,,,,,,,,AI Now Institute,,Sarah Myers West: Meredith Whittaker: Kate Crawford: ,,,West: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IP Report 6 - Shaping Choices in the Digital World : From dark patterns to data protection: the influence of ux/ui design on user umpowerment,"People live with all kinds of digital objects. These range from social networks to cutting-edge connected objects. They are now a fully-fledged part of our aesthetic relationship with the world, on a par with architecture or decorative art. A certain widely distributed and highly standardised aesthetic of digital media has been created, producing strong brands in users’ minds. Users are barely aware of this aesthetic, which is well thought out. Conditioning through design pre-empts everything that the individual handles or sees in the digital world.In the wake of Bauhaus, where design is based on the search for functional aesthetics, digital technology has become a relevant field of application in problem-solving. For, beyond the desire to avoid ugliness that “does not sell”, to quote Raymond Loewy, the digital promise is so broad that the functions provided by design seem endless, giving the key players that own them the expectation of a substantial return on investment.Web giants have understood this by competing to attract users, customising their experience, influencing – as subtly and as substantially as possible – their behaviour, in all fields, from leisure to politics. They stand as a compass to navi-gate the abundance of content and the anxiety of the non-optimisation of time.But this model is no longer followed. Maybe because it seems to “take advantage” of individuals, their “malleability” and tendency to become accustomed to simplicity. Concerns regarding personal data are a strong signal of the discomfort felt by users themselves.In this regard, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a major response and a first essential milestone towards greater transparency and a reaction to the crisis of confidence. It offers regulators several legal and technical instruments to make users the focal point of the data economy.But, to fight the model of individuals who are “objects of technology”, design can act as a rampart and deploy its firepower.The aim is not only to make objects beautiful but to propose an aesthetic to support another digital project. This project is not simply functional but humanistic, targeting sustainable goals that users can master; a project more imbued with common sense regarding the real needs of users taken in all their complexity.Prosaically, the aim is not to be deceived, to fully consent to the effort that companies want to relieve us of and ultimately say “yes” together. To do that, in practical terms, the interface is far from cosmetic.Design then reaches its full meaning, that of aesthetics to support humanity. It is beautiful as it is rooted in that humanity.This publication therefore aims to project some ideas to build this digital aesthetic. It addresses the entire digital ecosystem by giving some operational recommendations to strengthen the control and choice to which users are entitled. The CNIL intends to participate in this and considers the attention taken with design solutions as a poten-tial framework on which to build its legal and technical expertise and better fulfil its mission to protect freedoms.",https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/cnil_ip_report_06_shaping_choices_in_the_digital_world.pdf,report,,,,,,,,CNIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cnil.fr/en/media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"WP264 BCR ""responsables de traitements"" formulaire d'approbation (EN)","The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (‘GDPR’) allows personal data to be transferred outside the EEA only when the third country provides an ""adequate level of protection"" for the data (Art. 45) or when the controller adduces adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy (Art. 46). Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) are one of the ways in which such adequate safeguards (Art. 47) may be demonstrated by a group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity.

According to Article 64 GDPR, the use of BCRs as appropriate safeguards for international data transfers from the EEA requires the approval of the competent supervisory authority in accordance with the consistency mechanism set out in Article 63 without requiring any specific authorisation from a supervisory authority (Article 46.2.b GDPR). The following form is for use by companies seeking approval of BCRs.

The ethical matters raised by algorithms and artificial intelligence: how can humans keep the upper hand?,"The  hopes  and  fears  sparked  by  artificial  intelligence today  have  raised  it  to  mythological  status  in  many imaginaries and narratives. Some foresee the massive destruction of our jobs, the apocalyptic emergence of a hostile robotic consciousness or the downfall of Europe, called to get overwhelmed by the global competition. Others, meanwhile, are being pinned on the dream of a tailor-made world, a new Golden Age where every thankless or repetitive task would be  delegated  to  machines;  an  Eden  where  infallible  tools would have put an end to illness and crime, and perhaps even political conflict; in short, evil would have become a thing of the past. Under its myriad guises that are, by turn, fascinating or alarming, bright or gloomy, AI arguably says more about our fantasies and fears than about what our future world will look like. The appeal of this type of eschatological rhetoric in Europe is such that it shows to what extent technology allows visions of the future and generates a power to look ahead, which is sometimes lacking from our political visions.",https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/cnil_rapport_ai_gb_web.pdf,report,,,,,,,,CNIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cnil.fr/en/media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obligations  to  notify  in  cases  of  breaches  presently  exist  for  certain  organisations,  such  as  providers of  publicly-available  electronic  communications  services  (as  specified  in  Directive  2009/136/EC  and Regulation(EU)  No611/2013)2.There  are  also  some EU Member States that already have their ownnationalbreach  notification  obligation.

Whilst  a  number  of  EU  data  protection  authorities  currently  encourage controllers  to  report  breaches,  the  Data  Protection Directive  95/46/EC4,  which  the  GDPR  replaces, does  not  contain  a  specificbreach  notificationobligationand therefore such a requirement will be new for  many  organisations.

Alternatively,  the  organisation  may  only  carry  out  processing  activity  in  the  context  of  its establishment  in  France.  However,if  the  activity  substantially  affects –or  is  likely  to substantiallyaffect -data subjects in Franceand Romania then this will also constitute cross-border processing.

The purpose  of this  new right  is  to empower  the  data subject and give him/her more control overthe personal dataconcerning him or her.Since  it  allows  the  direct transmissionof  personal  data  from  one data  controllerto another,  the  right  to  data  portability  is also an  important  tool  that  will supportthe  free flow  of personal data  in  the  EU  and fostercompetition  between  controllers.

Guidelines on Data Protection Officers - DPO,"The General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’),1due to come into effect on 25 May 2018, providesa  modernised,  accountability-based  compliance  framework  for  data  protection  in  Europe.Data Protection Officers(‘DPO’s) will be at the heart of this new legal frameworkfor many organisations, facilitatingcompliance with the provisions of the GDPR.Under the GDPR, it ismandatory for certain controllers and processors to designate a DPO.2This will be the casefor all public authorities and bodies(irrespective of what data they process), andfor other organisations that-as a core activity -monitor individuals systematically and on a large scale, orthatprocess special categories of personal data on a large scale. Even  when  the GDPR  does  not  specifically  require  the appointment  of  a  DPO,  organisations may sometimes  find  it  useful  to  designate  a  DPO  on  a  voluntary  basis.  The Article  29  Data  Protection Working Party (‘WP29’) encourages these voluntary efforts.The  concept  of  DPO  is  not  new.  Although  Directive  95/46/EC3did  not  require any organisation  to appoint a DPO, the practice of appointing a DPO has nevertheless developed in several Member States over the years.Before  the  adoption  of  the  GDPR,  the WP29 argued that  the  DPO  is  a  cornerstone  of  accountability and that appointing a DPO can facilitate compliance and furthermore,become a competitive advantage for  businesses.4In  addition  to facilitating  compliance  through  theimplementation  of  accountability tools (such asfacilitating  data  protection  impact  assessmentsand carrying  out  or  facilitating audits),DPOsact as intermediariesbetween relevant stakeholders (e.g. supervisory authorities, data subjects, and businessunits within an organisation). DPOs are not personally responsible in case of non-compliance with the GDPR. The GDPR makes it clear that itis the controller or the processor who is required to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that the processing  is  performed  in  accordance  with its  provisions (Article  24(1)).  Data  protection compliance is a responsibility of the controller or the processor.",https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/guidelines_on_dpos_5_april_2017.pdf,report,,,,,,,,CNIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cnil.fr/en/media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keynote speech IAPP,"We are in a critical period. The GDPR has been adopted and we have less than 18 months to be ready. May 2018!  The countdown has started: for you and the new compliance obligations; and for us, DPAs, that need to finalize a new governance model and issue guidance to the controllers and processors in order to have a full harmonization. So there is a lot of work and effortsin front of us. 1.But I want to start by saying that it is worthit because the GDPR answers to new needs and trends we collectively have to face.First,  it  answers  to  the  confidence  crisis  that  has  emerged  since  the  last  three  years.  Following  the Snowdenrevelations, but more generally, confidence crisis of the consumers, the individuals, around the relationship they have with you,business representatives, as regard their data.People are more and more unable to understand the complex and fast evolving ecosystem; they feel they are “used” by it and not in a position to make their own choices. They want to be reassured.The GDPR answers to that by putting the individual at the center of the regulation.In particular, by reinforcing their rights or by recognizing new rights like the right to dataportability.",https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/keynote_speech_iapp_0.pdf,report,,,,,,,,CNIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cnil.fr/en/media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36th Activity Report 2015 - CNIL,"2015 began and ended with the violent attacks that plunged France into mourning. There will definitely be a before and an after 2015. Each of us was deeply hurt by the physical violence of these attacks on our democratic values, on what unites us and binds us, and which is the cornerstone of our identity as French and European citizens. These humanistic values hold special meaning for the CNIL’s 200 staff members and 17 Commissioners.  Since then, the cursor between security requirements and the defence of fundamental freedoms has unquestionably shifted. In this very particular context, underscored by intense emotion, the CNIL has maintained its course, seeking a delicate balance between disparate but not necessarily antagonistic requirements. Over and above their individual and collective impacts, these events have had a very direct impact on the CNIL’s activity. The Commission has had to issue opinions on 14 texts (implementing decrees and bills) related to coun-ter-terrorism measures or intelligence. While some of them were already planned, the attacks clearly hastened their implementation.

"IP Report : Innovation & Foresight #3 Data muses and borders of creative arts : Reading, listening, watching and gaming in the age of personalisation","Opinion polls regularly remind us that cultural practices take up a large portion of French people's daily life. And yet these surveys are missing something essential. They fail to show us the vital role played by culture in our individual and collective lives.Reading a book, listening to music, watching films and TV shows - as well as playing video games, no doubt - over and above their entertainment value, are probably the most suitable spheres for the development and permanent remodelling of our identity. It seems to me that the imaginary space they open up to us is a laboratory, a workshop in which we can compare what we think we are with other possible lives; where we can imagine ourselves with other ways of thinking, feeling, loving or, in short, living out our lives.

Compliance package Smart meters : Management of data collected in the home without communication to the outside,"In this scenario, the data collected in the home are under the sole control of the user and are not intended to be col-lected or reused by a third party, which can correspond to two cases:1.Purely “IN  IN”  applications: se-veral products or solutions communicate with each other without transferring data to the outside;For example: communication between the thermostat and the heating system, managing  the  heating  zone  by  zone,  placing the home in sleep mode when the occupant leaves it, deploying roller shutters based on the level of sunlight or ambient temperature in the zone de-termined by a sensor.2.Applications which involve a trans-fer of data from the home without such data being transmitted to third parties for reuse. This is the case of applications for which the data: remain confined within communi-cation networks fully under the user’s control (such as Wi-Fi or another local network); or circulate in public telecommunication networks (such as ADSL, fibre, GSM).For  example:  a  smartphone  appli-cation used by the data subject, which communicates  directly  with  the  ap-pliances installed within their home.The fact that the data are transmitted on networks managed by electronic com-munications operators does not pose any difficulties insofar as these operators have stringent obligations as to what they can do with such traffic data. This is however only valid if the operator in question acts as the provider of the electronic commu-nication service. Conversely, if the opera-tor wishes to provide another service, the applicable recommendations are those for Scenarios 2 or 3.",https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/fiche1_packconf_smart_meters_en_160615.pdf,standard,,,,,,,,CNIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cnil.fr/en/media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activity Report for 2011,"Today, the CNIL has reached a decisive step in its development. Confronted to structural muta-tions linked to the growth of the digital society, the Commission sits at the core of the international debate on data protection in the 21st century; a unique era that invites us to revisit our action.Structural changes first and foremost, as this is indeed a change of era driven by the digital age. Within just a few years, the digital world has become pervasive: with the increasing dematerialization of industries and services, we have shifted from a rather static, domestic world of physical records to an international, fluctuating universe of virtual data with multiple players involved. Data are pervasive and omnipres-ent everywhere, produced and con-sumed by individuals, enterprises and public authorities alike; and tomorrow, these data will increas-ingly deal with objects.

IP newsletter N°2 : Smartphones and Privacy: towards a new vision of data protection?',"In this age of all-digital revolution and at a time when a new landscape for data protection is being redesigned by the draft European Regulation, it is essential for CNIL to conduct a forward-looking strategic activity. It seemed natural for the smartphone to become the very first topic of the CNIL’s strategic planning research, in a world where this device is penetrating ever deeper into everyone’s daily life (7out of ten smartphone users never turn it off!). The first step of the research involved a status assessment of the practices and perceptions of smartphone users regarding the protection of their personal data. Such was the subject of the survey conducted in November 2011. Its results, analyzed in this Newsletter, have since led to the definition of an action plan. The survey findings indeed revealed a new kind of “privacy paradox”: as both a concentrator and a producer of personal data, the smartphone unfortunately remains a ‘black box’ for its owner, while at the same time a pressing need for data protection is emerging... Faced with such opacity, our action plan therefore intends among other to analyze in depth and decipher the ecosystem of smartphones, and to anticipate on future usage trends. Beyond this initial step, CNIL will endeavor to incite the various players in building a framework for more transparent and privacy-friendly products and services",https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/typo/document/2nd-IP_newsletter_EN.pdf,report,,,,,,,,CNIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cnil.fr/en/media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IP REPORTS N°1 : Privacy Towards 2020 (A4)',"What will be the key issues for personal data protection towards 2020? What will your privacy look like ? What will become of our digital freedoms in the ""everyone and always connected"" age? And what forms will regulation need to take in order to meet these new challenges?

The objective of this first edition of the Innovation & Foresight Report, a new CNIL publication, is to bring together these expert opinions. These experts have shared with us their visions – which naturally sometimes differ – of the key transformations and future developments in the field of privacy, freedoms and personal data, and their assessments – all highly instructive - of future forms of regulation. We shall be presenting and endeavouring to understand these visions and assessments, in order to see what use can be made of them by the regulator.",https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/typo/document/CAHIER_IP_EN2.pdf,report,,,,,,,,CNIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cnil.fr/en/media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IP newsletter N°3 : How can we control our personal data online?,"At a time when personal data has become a highly marketable commodity, finding an answer to this question is no simple task.Even so, no one can question the need for tools that will allow Internet users to regain control of their data and help build up trust in the digital economy. Last March, CNIL organized its first Privacy Camp on just this issue, with participants attempting to answer this difficult but crucial question.For CNIL, the event was a real innovation in terms of both form and content. Jointly coordinated by the Department of Studies, Innovation and Foresight and the Communication Department, its success proves that CNIL is on the right track with its open, collaborative approach. The Privacy Camp provided a forum for enthusiastic debate as well as criticism. A number of novel and imaginative proposals emerged, including some put forward by CNIL's innovation laboratory. Discussions focused on tools, practices, and services aimed at helping users learn more about online personal data flows and ‘leaks’ and control privacy online.",https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/typo/document/3rd-IP_newsletter_EN.pdf,report,,,,,,,,CNIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cnil.fr/en/media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recommendations for companies planning to use Cloud computing services,"From a legal standpoint, CNIL finds that Cloud computing raises a number of difficulties with regard  to  compliance  with  the  legislation  on  the  protection  of  personal  data,  in  particular  in the  case  of  public  Cloud.  These  difficulties  are  amplified  in  the  case  of  standard  offers  with standard  contracts  thatcustomers are  not  able  to  negotiate.  In  general,  it  is  found  that customers suffer from a lack of transparency on the part of Cloud service providers regarding the  conditions  for  provision  of  the  services,  particularly in  terms  ofsecurity  and knowing whether their data are transferred abroad, and more precisely, to which country.Consequently,  it  is  essential  that  any  French  company  planning  to  use  a  Cloud  computing service  conducts  a  risk  analysis  and  is  very  strict  in  the  choice  of  its  service  provider.  In particular,  the  company  must  take  into  consideration  the  guarantees  offered  by  a  service provider  regarding  the  protection  of  personal  data  and  must  make  sure  that  the  service provider  will  give itall  the  necessary  guarantees  to  fulfil  its  obligations  under  the  Data Protection  Act,  particularly  in  terms  of  information todata  subjects, regulationof  transfers and data security. Note that if it is impossible to negotiate a contract, it is essential to compare the contractual conditions proposed by the different service providers. This allows a choice to be made based on both economicand legal and technical considerations",https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/typo/document/Recommendations_for_companies_planning_to_use_Cloud_computing_services.pdf,report,,,,,,,,CNIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cnil.fr/en/media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Security of Personal Data,"This English translation of the guide Sécurité des données personellespublished in 2010 was motivated  by  frequent  requests receivedfromnon  French-speaking  readers.  It  is  the  first guide we translateinto English. Thisis both a clear sign of our significant investment in IT security and of our commitment to advance the protection of personal data in a globalized international environement.Ever since the birth of Internet, security of personal data has been an issue that has known no borders. Today, this is even more true in a world of extensive externalization and cloud computing, where major cyberattacks make the headlines almost everymonth.The  European  directive  on  the  protection  of  personal  data  unambiguiously  requires  all companies  to  implement  adequate  security  measures  if  they  are  established  in  a  member state or otherwise make use of data processing means situated in Europe. Our commission is  strongly commited to  promote this  principle nationaly,  as  well  as internationaly through increased cooperation with other data protection authorities. As such, this guide should be of  interest  not  only  to  controllers  established  in  France  but  more  generally,to  any  entity that directly or indirectly uses IT systems in our country.In this  context, this  document represents  a  significant  work to  catalogue IT  best  practices when  processing  personal  data  for  small  to  medium-size  companies.  A  collection  of  about fourty  security  measures  are  listed,  allowing  to  assess  the  overall  security  of  the  most common personal data processing requirements.We  are  confident  that  this  work  will  help  improving  the  adoption  of  elementary  best practices.

Activity report 2009,"Is there more presumptuous exercise than claiming to recount in a few lines theextensive work accomplished with passion and enthusiasm by 170 men and women,commissioners and staff members alike, in the service of individual liberties?At the very best, one can attempt to recall the highlights with a few flashbacks,highlights both good and perhaps not so pleasant...One such happy time was the day when the power to deliver quality labels was finallygranted to our Commission by the Law of 12 May 2009 on the Simplification of Law.It had previously been granted by the Law of 6 August 2004, yet the project had notmaterialised for lack of any enforcement decrees. Another happy moment was theCommission’s budget extension granted by the Prime Minister, thereby comfortingthe trend initiated since 2004.Not so pleasant was the time when the Warsmann amendment nearly jeopardisedthat very same budget for a few hours...Another highlight, this one neither good nor bad but a true milestone, was thepublication of our audit report on the STIC system.Lastly, we should mention one disappointment at not having convinced thecommission in charge of revising the Preamble to the 1958 Constitution of the needto constitutionalise the right to personal data protection.A source of great satisfaction is the realisation that our Commission is increasinglypresent in major societal debates, increasingly approached by public authorities, andincreasingly heard by our fellow citizens.",https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/typo/document/CNIL-30e_rapport_2009-EN.pdf,report,,,,,,,,CNIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cnil.fr/en/media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Principles on Identification for Sustainable Development : Toward the Digital Age (English)',"Some one billion people in the developing world lack proof of legal identity. Living without proof of legal identity is a serious obstacle to social, economic, and political inclusion. It also makes it difficult for an individual to open a bank account, vote, obtain formal employment, access education or healthcare, receive a social transfer, buy a SIM card, or seek legal redress. Furthermore, a person without identification may be unable to exercise the full range of human rights set out in international laws and conventions. Weak civil identification systems also represent challenges for countries such as governance planning, service delivery, public sector administration, collecting taxes, border control and emergency response. As public and private service providers increasingly transition into the digital realm, the ability for individuals to prove who they are will be essential for accessing benefits and services via digital platforms. This move toward digital platforms can increase efficiency of service delivery, create significant savings for citizens, governments, and businesses by reducing transaction costs, as well as drive innovation. This can generate many benefits, but can also exacerbate the risk of isolation for poorly-connected populations including rural and remote communities, the forcibly displaced, stateless persons and other marginalized groups. Leveling the playing field requires a coordinated, sustained effort by countries as well as stakeholders involved in the provision and use of identification systems. A shared vision through this set of common Principles can contribute to robust and universal identification systems that in turn promote social and economic inclusion and sustainable development outcomes.

A new digital society (p. 6)

We believe that personal data is one of the most essential societal issues of the XXIst century. Personal data is not solely about technology as it encompasses also legal, design, social and economic issues. At the same time, in a technological world, technological standards are key as they shape actual practices, so there is a need to ensure that the values we want to prevail in our society are well embedded in the technologies we create and use every day. We want a responsible and ethical digital society that benefits people, businesses and society. 

A fair and efficient digital society requires personal data to flow freely under the strict control of individuals themselves. It is perfectly aligned with the EU Digital Single Market strategy. As the importance of personal data in society continues to expand, it becomes increasingly urgent to make sure individuals are in a position to control their personal data, but also to gain personal knowledge from them and to claim their share of benefits. Healthcare, smart cities, environmental protection count among the many examples of tomorrow’s challenges requiring an optimal circulation of data between organizations and, at the same time, a use that is well understood, accepted and most of all put under the control of individuals.",https://www.anewgovernance.org/executive-summary-privacytech-white-paper/,paper,,,,,,,,A New Governance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DATA INTEROPERABILITY:  A PRACTITIONER’S GUIDE TO JOINING UP DATA IN THE DEVELOPMENT SECTOR',"The first United Nations World Data Forum (UNWDF) took place in Cape Town, South Africa, in January 2017. At that Forum, the foundations were laid for a new joint endeavour to explore opportunities and identify good practices for enhancing data interoperability in the area of sustainable development.

These aims are today embodied in the Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability, established in March 2017 at a side-event to the 48th UN Statistical Commission and convened by the UN Statistical Division (UNSD) and Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD).

At the Data for Development Festival in Bristol in March 2017, the Collaborative agreed to produce guidance on data interoperability for development practitioners. This resulted in the launching in October 2018, at the second UN World Data Forum taking place in Dubai, of the first version of a document entitled ""Data interoperability: A practitioner's guide to joining up data in the development sector"". 

The Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability will continue to build and maintain the Guide in this electronic space as it develops as a tool, adding new modules and examples as well as ancillary materials to help raise awareness of its existence and usability.

It is hoped that new synergies will form between data producers, publishers, users, and those providing capacity building and training. In this way, the guidance set out within the Guide can be incorporated into existing training materials and modules, and a consistent approach to the system-wide improvement of data interoperability can start to become a reality in the development sector.

A tiered-layered-staged model for informed consent in personal genome testing,"In recent years, developments in genomics technologies have led to the rise of commercial personal genome testing (PGT): broad genome-wide testing for multiple diseases simultaneously. While some commercial providers require physicians to order a personal genome test, others can be accessed directly. All providers advertise directly to consumers and offer genetic risk information about dozens of diseases in one single purchase. The quantity and the complexity of risk information pose challenges to adequate pre-test and post-test information provision and informed consent. There are currently no guidelines for what should constitute informed consent in PGT or how adequate informed consent can be achieved. In this paper, we propose a tiered-layered-staged model for informed consent. First, the proposed model is tiered as it offers choices between categories of diseases that are associated with distinct ethical, personal or societal issues. Second, the model distinguishes layers of information with a first layer offering minimal, indispensable information that is material to all consumers, and additional layers offering more detailed information made available upon request. Finally, the model stages informed consent as a process by feeding information to consumers in each subsequent stage of the process of undergoing a test, and by accommodating renewed consent for test result updates, resulting from the ongoing development of the science underlying PGT. A tiered-layered-staged model for informed consent with a focus on the consumer perspective can help overcome the ethical problems of information provision and informed consent in direct-to-consumer PGT.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658183/,paper,,,,,,,,European Journal of Human Genetics,,Eline M Bunnik: A Cecile J W Janssens: Maartje H N Schermer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NIST Privacy Framework,"The NIST Privacy Framework is currently under development. NIST envisions that it will be a voluntary tool for organizations to better identify, assess, manage, and communicate about privacy risks so that individuals can enjoy the benefits of innovative technologies with greater confidence and trust.

For more than two decades, the Internet and associated information technologies have driven unprecedented innovation, economic value, andaccess to social services. Many of these benefits are fueled by dataabout individualsthat flowthrough a complex ecosystem. As a result, individualsmay not be ableto understand the potential consequences for their privacy as theyinteract with systems, products, and services. Organizationsmay notfully realize theconsequenceseither. Failure to manage privacy riskscan have direct adverse consequences at both the individual and societal levels, with follow-on effects on organizations’ brands, bottom lines, and future prospects for growth. Finding ways to continue to derive benefits from data processingwhile simultaneously protecting individuals’ privacy ischallenging, and not well-suited to one-size-fits-all solutions.Privacy is challenging because not only is it an all-encompassingconceptthat helps to safeguard important values such as human autonomy and dignity, but also the means for achieving it can vary.3For example, privacy can be achieved through seclusion,limiting observation, orindividuals’ controlof facets of their identities(e.g.,body, data, reputation).4Moreover, human autonomy and dignity are not fixed, quantifiable constructs; they are filtered throughcultural diversityand individual differences.Thisbroad and shifting nature of privacy makesit difficult to communicateclearlyabout privacy risks within and between organizations and with individuals. What has been missing is a common languageand practical toolthat is flexible enough to address diverse privacy needs.Thisvoluntary NIST Privacy Framework: ATool for Improving Privacy throughEnterprise Risk Management (Privacy Framework) is intended to be widely usable by organizations of all sizes and agnosticto any particular technology, sector, law, or jurisdiction. Using a common approach—adaptabletoany organization’srole(s)in thedata processing ecosystem—the Privacy Framework’s purpose is tohelp organizationsmanage privacy risks by:•Taking privacy into account as they design and deploysystems, products, and servicesthat affect individuals;•Communicatingabout their privacypractices;and•Encouraging cross-organizational workforcecollaboration—for example,amongexecutives, legal, and information technology (IT)—through thedevelopment ofProfiles, selection of Tiers, and achievement of outcomes",https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework,specification,,,,,,,,NIST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CAPrice - Collective Awareness Platform for Privacy Concerns and Expectations (with subtitles),"Many of the devices (smartphones, smart TVs etc) and digital services (apps, web services etc) that are part of our everyday routine require access to our personal data in order to function. Often, these data are subsequently given to third parties and used for tracking and advertising purposes. Even though such practices are usually specified in the associated Terms and Conditions, these are complex legal documents that most people don’t actually read.

We believe in a world where private data are protected from unjustified access and where people are truly aware of the privacy-related ramifications of using different devices or digital services. To realize this vision, we propose a crowdsourcing solution that will harness the power of the masses to improve the awareness of people on the content of Terms and Conditions, as well as to explicate the community’s related expectations, thereby exerting pressure on developers in supporting such expectations.

The UK Government takes the issue of consumer IoT security very seriously. We recognise the urgent need to move the expectation away from consumers securing their own devices and instead ensure that strong cyber security is built into these products by design.

Having worked with stakeholders, experts and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), we are now consulting on proposals for new mandatory industry requirements to ensure consumer smart devices adhere to a basic level of security. The proposals set out in this consultation seek to better protect consumers’ privacy and online security which can be put at risk by insecure devices.

How SSI Will Survive Capitalism,"The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) community has described several groundbreaking properties that arise from the adoption of its principles. Governance, as in business and fnancing structure, is arguably the most challenging of these properties, captured succinctly by Shoshana Zubof as: ""Who decides? Who decides who decides?"" However,even though the technology has matured greatly over recent years, bootstrapping an SSI product within the existing capitalistic market environment is complicated and has not been achieved at scale within any functional domain.A RWOT6 paper explored the challenges to a sustainable commons. In this paper, we apply the SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) to identify potential paths to adoption. For example, what are the general implications of introducing a credential holder into existing issuer/verifer relationships? Our analysis leads to cooperative (in the legal sense) governance with focus on the holder (the wallet) as the key innovation, since issuers and verifers already exist. The healthcare industry is used as an example.",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/final-documents/how-ssi-will-survive-capitalism.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT VIII,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, there are some tools, like JSFiddle https://jsfddle.net/ that let you interactively play with JavaScript content, but nothing that combined the static parts of curriculum, like examples, illustrations, and explanations, with interactive parts where you could actually try some code out.

Using OpenID Connect Self-Issued to Achieve DID Auth,"Proving control of a DID requires proving ownership of a private key corresponding to a public key for the DID. Of course, this could be done with a new DID-specifc protocol.

BTCR v0.1 Decisions,"The Bitcoin Reference (BTCR) DID method supports DIDs using the Bitcoin blockchain. This method has been under development through Rebooting Web of Trust events and hackathons over the past year. The BTCR method's reliance on the Bitcoin blockchain presents both advantages and design challenges. During RWOT7, the authors made a number of design and implementation decisions -- largely scope-cutting in nature -- in order to lock down a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version, which we'll refer to as v0.1.

A DID for Everything,"The decentralized identifer (DID) is a new and open standard type of globally unique identifer that ofers a model for lifetime-scope portable digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and that can never be taken away by third-parties [14]. DIDs are supported by the W3C community [14] and the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) [16]. They are the ""atomic units"" of a new layer of decentralized identity infrastructure. However, DIDs can be extended from identifers for people to any entity, thus identifying everything. We can use DIDs to help us identify and manage objects, machines, or agents through their digital twins; we can expand them to locations, to events, and even to pure data objects, which we refer to as decentralized autonomic data (DAD) items [1][3].",https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/final-documents/A_DID_for_everything.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT VII,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we provide requirements for digital credential wallet design, ofer considerations for key management of DCWs, and go over several real-life use cases.INTRODUCTIONDigital credentials are seeing widespread usage as governments, businesses, and individuals increasingly come online. Users need to be able to store these credentials for ease of use. Moreover, others validating these credentials need to be able to do so in a secure manner. In order to do this, digital credentials are stored in what are called DigitalCredentialWallets (DCW).The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the considerations needed to build digital credential wallets and various use cases to put these considerations into perspective.",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/final-documents/digital-credential-wallet.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT VII,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How to Convince Dad* of the Importance of Self-Sovereign Identity,"One of the major problems with bootstrapping self-sovereign identity is that it requires adoption by a large number of people. Pushing self-sovereign identity from the top-down is most likely to result in a technology that’s not actually used, but instead encouraging the average person to demand self-sovereign identity from the bottom-up will result in the organic development of a vibrant, well-utilized decentralized web-of-trust ecosystem.This paper addresses that need by ofering arguments to a variety of people who might be reluctant to use self-sovereign identity, uninterested in its possibilities, or oblivious to the dangers of centralization. By focusing on theneeds of real people, we hope to also encourage developers, engineers, and software business owners to create the apps that will address their reluctance and fulfll their needs, making self-sovereign identity a reality",http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/convincing-dad.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT VII,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peer to Peer Degrees of Trust,"Authenticity is a challenge for any identity solution. In the physical world, at least in America, it is not difcult to change one's identity1. In the digital world, there is the problem of bots. The botnet detection market is expected to be worth over one billion USD by 20232, in a landscape where most digital activity is still heavily centralized. These centralized digital solutions have the advantage of being able to track IP addresses, request phone verifcation, and present CAPTCHAs to users in order to authenticate them.

Resource Integrity Proofs,"Currently, the Web provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for the dissemination of information via links. Unfortunately, there is no generalized mechanism that enables verifying that a fetched resource has been deliveredwithout unexpected manipulation. Would it be possible to create an extensible and multipurpose cryptographic link that provides discoverability, integrity, and scheme agility?This paper proposes a linking solution that decouples integrity information from link and resource syntaxes, enabling verifcation of any representation of a resource from any type of link. We call this approach Resource Integrity Proofs (RIPs). RIPs provide a succinct way to link to resources with cryptographically verifable contentintegrity. RIPs can be combined with blockchain technology to create discoverable proofs of existence to of-chain resources.",http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/resource-integrity-proofs.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT VII,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decentralized Autonomic Data (DAD) and the three R's of Key Management,"This paper proposes a new class of data called decentralized autonomic data (DAD). The term decentralizedmeans that the governance of the data may not reside with a single party. A related concept is that the trust in the data provenance is difuse in nature. Central to the approach is leveraging the emerging DID (decentralized identifer) standard. The term autonomic means self-managing or self-regulating. In the context of data, we crystalize the meaning of self-managing to include cryptographic techniques for maintaining data provenance that make the data self-identifying, self-certifying, and self-securing. Implied thereby is the use of cryptographic keys and signatures to provide a root of trust for data integrity and to maintain that trust over transformation of that data, e.g. provenance. Thus key management must be a frst order property of DADs. This includes key reproduction, rotation, and recovery. The pre-rotation and hybrid recovery methods presented herein are somewhat novel.",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/final-documents/DecentralizedAutonomicData.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT VI,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction to DID Auth,"The term DID Auth has been used in different ways and is currently not well-defined. We define DID Auth as a ceremony where an identity owner, with the help of various components such as web browsers, mobile devices, and other agents, proves to a relying party that they are in control of a DID. This means demonstrating control of the DID using the mechanismspecified in the DID Document's ""authentication"" object. This could take place using a number of different data formats, protocols, and flows. DID Auth includes the ability to establish mutually authenticated communication channels and to authenticate to web sites and applications. Authorization, Verifiable Credentials, and Capabilities are built on top of DID Auth and are out of scope for this document. This paper gives on overview of the scope of DID Auth, supported protocols and flows, and the use of components of the DID Documents that are relevant to authentication, as well as formats for challenges and responses.",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/final-documents/did-auth.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT VI,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ActivityPub: From Decentralized to Distributed Social Cetworks,"ActivityPub is a protocol being developed at the W3C for the purpose of building federated social systems. Users can use implementations of ActivityPub like Mastodon and MediaGoblin as libre alternatives to large siloed socialnetworking systems such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram1.In general ActivityPub follows the client-server paradigm that has been popular on the World Wide Web, while restoring some level of decentralization. Current implementations of ActivityPub go as far as to bring a level of decentralization akin to email2, but there are many opportunities to go further.By attaching public keys to the profles of actors (users) on the network and using Linked Data Signatures, we can add a web of trust to the federated social web and use it to enhance user privacy and to assert the integrity ofmessages sent over the network.By using a decentralized identifer system such as Decentralized Identifers (DIDs) we can move fully from a decentralized to a distributed system3, by escaping the core centralization mechanisms of DNS and SSL certifcate authorities.At this point, users could even optionally transition from a client-server model system to a fully peer-to-peer system",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/final-documents/activitypub-decentralized-distributed.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT V,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design Considerations for Decentralized Reputation Systems,"Reputation systems provide an efective way to builda web of trust on the Internet. They consider the history of interactions between peers to establish a measure for a reputation that can itself be used to support a trust decision. Decentralised reputations systems (DRS) rely on a decentralised computer architecture and a distributed ledger to store and maintain reputation information, so that no single entity has control over that information.While there have been numerous analyses of how reputation may be used, there has to date been no systematic defnition of the various aspects that should be considered when a reputation system is being designed.

This approach avoids past concerns about JWT raised in the LD signature adopters, including:•Increased space consumption associated withbase-64 encoding.•Difculty of nesting or chaining signatures, leading to data duplication.•Use of a format that is not a JSON object, preventing ability to rely exclusively on a JSON document-based storage engine (whilepreserving the signature)",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2017/blob/master/final-documents/ld-signatures.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT IV,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DID (Decentralized Identifier) Data Model and Generic Syntax 1.0 Implementer’s Draft 01,"DIDs(decentralized   identifiers)   are   a   new   type   of identifier  intended  for  verifiable  digital  identity  that  is ""self-sovereign"",   i.e.,   fully   under   the   control   of   the identity   ownerand   not   dependent   on   a   centralized registry,  identity  provider,  or  certificate  authority.  DIDs resolve to DDOs(DID descriptor objects)—simple JSON documents  that  contain  all  the  metadata  needed  to  prove ownership  and  control  of  a  DID.  Specifically,  a  DDO contains  a  set  of key  descriptions,  which  are  machine-readable descriptions of the identity owner’s public keys, and   a   set   of service   endpoints,   which   are   resource pointers  necessary  to  initiate  trusted  interactions  with  the identity  owner.

Embedding Human Wisdom in Our Digital Tomorrow,"Much  of  what  we  know  as  a  species  has  accreted through experience. We’ve seen things work and fail, and   we’ve   reacted:   we've   created   checks   and balances,    institutions    and    procedures,    making calculated tradeoffs for the net benefit of individuals and communities. This wisdom is embodied in laws, social norms, patterns, proverbs, and traditions.The  digital  landscape,  with  its  turbulent  pace  and its  jockeying  technologies,  is  a  new  dimension  of shared experience. Identity is a central aspect of that new  dimension.  Who  we  are,  how  we  interact,  how we  give  and  receive  value,  and  how  we  hold  one another  accountable  are  all  integral  to  identity —and  they  are  every  bit  as  important  to  the  digital landscape as they were in pre-digital times.",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/master/final-documents/WisdomEmbedding-Human-Wisdom-in-Our-Digital-Tomorrow.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT III,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smart Consent Protocol,"Personal  Data  are  valuable  resources  for  creating digital intellectual property (IP). Rights over this IP have  generally  been  unclear,  resulting  in  systematic abuse  or  unfair  use  of  people's  personal  data  by third parties.

Third  parties must  now  obtain  explicit  and  documented  consent from people (data subjects) to collect, process, store or  disclose  their  personal  data.  A  specification  for operationalising these regulatory requirements, using digital Consent Receipts, is being developed through the   Consent   and   Information-Sharing   Working Group of the Kantara Initiative.

Identity Crisis: Clear Identity through Correlation,"The term “identity” is a challenge.Both laypeople and experts struggle to communicate clearly  about  it.  The  term  has  numerous  rich  and useful    meanings.    That    same    flexibility    and expressivity  also  makes  it  easy  to  misunderstand subtle nuances and often leads to ideological debate rather  than  understanding  and  applications.  We compensate  with adjectives, creating new phrases like “digital identity” or “legal identity”, but we often still  speak  past  each  other.  We  regularly  refer  to “identities” as things that are assigned to us or that we  own,  things  we  control  or  present,  instead  of using  more  rigorous  terms  such  as  “identifiers”  or “credentials”. This fluidity often confuses because, at its  core,  identity  is  an  emergent  phenomenon  that doesn’t   have   an   existence   independent   of   the observer.",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/final-documents/identity-crisis.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT II,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Powering the Physician-Patient Relationship with HIE of One Blockchain Health IT,"Address whether there is a place in health IT and/or  healthcare  related  research  for  the technology [1];Together,  physicians  and  patients  steer  treatment and   are   responsible   for   the   vast   majority   of decisions,  and  therefore  expenditures,  in  healthcare. Yet  the  technology  that  mediates  the  physician-patient  relationship  today  is  not  directly  purchased or   controlled   by   either   the   physicians   or   the patients.   Electronic   health   records   and   health information   exchange   technology   are   sold   as strategic assets to institutions— typically very large businesses,   that   currently   have   incentives   to maximize  institutional  growth.

Requirements for DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers),"Respect Network is conducting a research project for the    U.S.    Department    of    Homeland    Security, HSHQDC-16-C-00061, to analyze the applicability of blockchain  technologies  to  a  decentralized  identifier system.  Our  thesis  is  that  blockchains,  or  more generically  distributed  ledgers,  are  a  potentially powerful new tool for “identity roots” — the starting points for an Internet identity. However “blockchain identity” may not fully address the core security and privacy  principles  needed  in  a  complete  identity system.   In   this   case   DIDs — Decentralized Identifiers rooted on a distributed ledger — may end up  being  a  foundational  building  block  for  higher level identity management solutions.During  this  phase  of  our  work,  we  interviewed industry    experts    in    identity    and    blockchain technology,  both  in  informal  discussions  at  major identity  conferences  as  well  as  in-depth  interviews.

Creating the New World of Trust,"On November 3rd and 4th, the Rebuilding the Web of Trust design workshop looked at the future of decentralized trust on the internet with the goal of producing 3-5 white papers and specs. Those papers were polished for release in December, leaving the question: what's next?Our major goal is to produce something notable for the 25th anniversary of PGP, in July 2016. This should be a working proof-of-concept that can help the Web of Trust to reach a broader audience. It should be something that's both usable and used and it needs to be compelling.If we can meet this goal, we can make our design ideas into reality.",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/whats-the-next-step.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT I,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure,"Today’s Internet places control of online identities into the hands of third-parties. Email addresses, usernames, and website domains are borrowed or ""rented"" through DNS, X.509, and social networks. This results in severe usability and security challenges Internet-wide. This paper describes a possible alternate approach called decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI), which returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to. By doing so, DPKI addresses many usability and security challenges that plague traditional public key infrastructure (PKI). DPKI has advantages at each stage of the PKI life cycle. It makes permissionless bootstrapping of online identities possible and provides for the simple creation of stronger SSL certificates. In usage, it can help “Johnny” to finally encrypt thanks to its relegation of public key management to secure decentralized datastores. Finally, it includes mechanisms to recover lost or compromised identifiers.",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT I,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Opportunities Created by the Web of Trust for Controlling and Leveraging Personal Data,"In November 2015 Facebook's share price broke $100 USD/share, for a total valuation of $290 billion USD. This is evidence that both Facebook and the market understand the value of controlling and leveraging personal data. However, the now-conventional absorb-everything design of Facebook is a blunt one. Employing users as passive producers with no control of their own data only scratches the surface of what is possible with networks of information and identity.Some of these constraints arise from Facebook's centralization, something that tends to worsen as an organization grows in size. There are limits to the amount of trust this sort of centralized authority can garner. This often results in punitive postures: democracies come with the expectation that citizens be forever watchful of their government; while corporations are watched over by regulatory bureaus and further deterred by class-action suits.Decentralized systems that are engineered to prevent concentrating power as they grow avoid this. They can in fact increase their credibility as more users provide their assessments as input. Protocols and structures that are distributed and self-sovereign also offer significantly improved robustness, portability, and versatility than conventional centralized or escrowed processes — especially when combined with secure cryptography.One of the first technologies to offer the advantages of decentralization emerged 25 years ago when the advent of PGP realized a Web of Trust that contained decentralized, cryptographically verified attestations of its users. Unfortunately, failures of UX design confined the spread of PGP to highly technical communities.Today, decentralized Webs of Trust remain as important as ever. Now is the time to extend them to be usable by everyone who has access to digital networks, in particular to marginalized populations that can benefit from the technology. It is a fortunate tragedy that there is no shortage of real-life examples of the need for decentralized Webs of Trust in the world today. A large spectrum of individuals —from marginalized persons like stateless refugees and victims of human trafficking to members of the informal or unregulated economy — urgently need to participate in otherwise privileged economic and political fora, but they face technical, economic, and political barriers to entry.The essential problem is to connect burgeoning new technological developments with unmet consumer needs, and vice-versa. In this paper, we present five use cases: from two relatively simple cases of managing selective disclosure to the most extreme case of establishing government-verifiable credentials from nothing for a stateless refugee.Each case identifies basic technical implementation needs, presents a brief solution sketch, and outlines potential user experience. Afterward, we discuss common themes and summarize future prospects.",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/satisfying-real-world-use-cases.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT I,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rebranding the Web of Trust,"The Web of Trust. It’s the buzzword for a new model of decentralized identity. However, it’s also a phrase that dates back almost twenty-five years and has been heavily overloaded with meaning during that time. The classic definition of Web of Trust derives from PGP, but the top Google results refer to a website reputation rating system created by a Finnish internet company. Meanwhile, some use it as a big tent that includes identity authentication & verification, certificate validation, and reputation assessment, while the vibrant blockchain community is also drawing new attention to the classic concept.To build a contemporary Web of Trust, we need to better define it. To do so, we must both understand what the classic Web of Trust was and create a model for the elements of trust that are contained within a more modern definition.",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/rebranding-web-of-trust.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT I,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Smart Signatures,"Traditional cryptographic signature systems are based on strictly-defined authentication and authorization mechanisms that assume a single private key can be used to produce a given signature and that a single public key can be used to verify it. Given the evident limitations of this design, we propose an alternative with more powerful capabities, based on the ability to explicitly outline and fully program conditions for verification. These conditions would then be used to determine when a signature or set of signatures can be considered valid.Our inspiration for this authorization system is the bitcoin scripting language, where the authorization to spend funds is explicitly defined within a script, rather than being implicitly defined through the reference to an authorized public key. The largest benefit of explicit specification of authorization conditions is that the system is fully extensible, so new operations can be defined at any time, with the only limitation being the set of operations that the authorization interpreters understand.",https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/smart-signatures.pdf,paper,,,,RWOT I,,,,Rebooting Web-of-Trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Media Manipulation and Disinformation Online,"""the spread of false or misleading information is having real and negative effects on the public consumption of news.""

    Internet subcultures take advantage of the current media ecosystem to manipulate news frames, set agendas, and propagate ideas.
    Far-right groups develop techniques of “attention hacking” to increase the visibility of their ideas through the strategic use of social media, memes, and bots—as well as by targeting journalists, bloggers, and influencers to help spread content.
    The media’s dependence on social media, analytics and metrics, sensationalism, novelty over newsworthiness, and clickbait makes them vulnerable to such media manipulation.

    While trolls, white nationalists, Men's Rights Activists, gamergaters, the ""alt-right,"" and conspiracy theorists may diverge deeply in their beliefs, they share tactics and converge on common issues.
    The far-right exploits young men’s rebellion and dislike of “political correctness” to spread white supremacist thought, Islamophobia, and misogyny through irony and knowledge of internet culture.
    Media manipulation may contribute to decreased trust of mainstream media, increased misinformation, and further radicalization.

When Media Companies Insist They’re Not Media Companies and Why It Matters for Communications Policy,"D&S researcher Robyn Caplan co-wrote a paper analyzing how many large well-known companies, such as Buzzfeed and Facebook, argue against being categorized as media companies. However, Caplan and co-writer Philip M. Napoli assert that this argument has led to a misclassification of these companies and such misclassification has profound policy implications.

    A common position amongst online content providers/aggregators is their resistance to being characterized as media companies. Companies such as Google, Facebook, BuzzFeed, and Twitter have argued that it is inaccurate to think of them as media companies. Rather, they argue that they should be thought of as technology companies. The logic of this position, and its implications for communications policy, have yet to be thoroughly analyzed. However, such an analysis is increasingly necessary as the dynamics of news and information production, dissemination, and consumption continue to evolve. This paper will explore and critique the logic and motivations behind the position that these content providers/aggregators are technology companies rather than media companies, as well as the communications policy implications associated with accepting or rejecting this position.

Facebook Must Acknowledge and Change Its Financial Incentives,"D&S researcher Robyn Caplan writes about fake news and Facebook in the NYT.

    Media organizations were especially left behind when Facebook changed its algorithm in June to privilege friends and family over major publishers, which happens to have occurred just prior to the spike in fake news before the election. Facebook must create institutionalized pathways for journalists and policymakers to help shape any further changes to the algorithm.

    The question of whether Facebook is saving or ruining journalism is not relevant here because, like it or not, Facebook is a media company. That became more apparent recently as human editors became a visible part of Facebook’s news curation process. In truth, this team is only a tiny fraction of a network of actors whose decisions affect the inner workings of Facebook’s platform and the content we see.

Facebook Must Be Accountable to the Public,"    This issue goes far beyond the Trending box in the corner of your Facebook profile, and this latest wave of concerns is only the tip of the iceberg around how powerful actors can affect or shape political discourse. What is of concern right now is not that human beings are playing a role in shaping the news — they always have — it is the veneer of objectivity provided by Facebook’s interface, the claims of neutrality enabled by the integration of algorithmic processes, and the assumption that what is prioritized reflects only the interests and actions of the users (the “public sphere”) and not those of Facebook, advertisers, or other powerful entities.

No More Magic Algorithms: Cultural Policy in an Era of Discoverability,"    Could policies exist to guide what algorithms find relevant? Algorithms depend on data to make recommendations. Could certain cultural metadata be embedded to ensure Canadian content has other pathways of discovery beyond a platform’s usual recommendations? Or could the Canadian industry agree to relevance standards that would help them qualify influence just like Upworthy and NPR have developed new ways to identify stories that matter to their readers.

    While we debate Canadian content algorithms, we also have to take seriously the much broader accountability issues raised by algorithms. It’s not just a matter of whether algorithms should promote Canadian content, but how we can understand this black box of new media power in the first place.

Facebook Trending: It’s made of people!! (but we should have already known that),"D&S Advisor Tarleton Gillespie responds to Gizmodo’s recent piece alleging bias in Facebook’s Trending Topics list. He argues that information algorithms like the ones used to identify “trends” on Facebook do not work alone and cannot work alone and argues that “in so many ways that we must simply discard the fantasy that they do, or ever will.”

    People are in the algorithm because how could they not be? People produce the Facebook activity being measured, people design the algorithms and set their evaluative criteria, people decide what counts as a trend, people name and summarize them, and people look to game the algorithm with their next posts.

    Trending algorithms are undeniably becoming part of the cultural landscape, and revelations like Gizmodo’s are helpful steps in helping us shed the easy notions of what they are and how they work, notions the platforms have fostered. Social media platforms must come to fully realize that they are newsmakers and gatekeepers, whether they intend to be or not, whether they want to be or not. And while algorithms can chew on a lot of data, it is still a substantial, significant, and human process to turn that data into claims about importance that get fed back to millions of users. This is not a realization that they will ever reach on their own — which suggests to me that they need the two countervailing forces that journalism has: a structural commitment to the public, imposed if not inherent, and competition to force them to take such obligations seriously.

    “In this paper, however, we contend that these concepts render technical interventions ineffective, inaccurate, and sometimes dangerously misguided when they enter the societal context that surrounds decision-making systems. We outline this mismatch with five “traps” that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.”",https://datasociety.net/output/fairness-and-abstraction-in-sociotechnical-systems/,Report,,,,"AI on the Ground: ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency",,,,Data & Society Research Institute,,Andrew D.

Moral Crumple Zones: Cautionary Tales In Human-Robot Interaction',"In this Working Paper from We Robot 2016, D&S Researcher Madeleine Elish employs the concept of “moral crumple zones” within human-machine systems as a lens through which to think about the limitations of current frameworks for accountability in human-machine or robot systems.

Abstract:

A prevailing rhetoric in human-robot interaction is that automated systems will help humans do their jobs better. Robots will not replace humans, but rather work alongside and supplement human work. Even when most of a system will be automated, the concept of keeping a “human in the loop” assures that human judgment will always be able to trump automation. This rhetoric emphasizes fluid cooperation and shared control. In practice, the dynamics of shared control between human and robot are more complicated, especially with respect to issues of accountability.",https://datasociety.net/output/moral-crumple-zones-cautionary-tales-in-human-robot-interaction/,Report,,,,AI on the Ground,,,,Data & Society Research Institute,,Madeleine Clare Elish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nannies Already Felt Like They Were Under Constant Surveillance. The Internet Has Made It Even Worse.,"Drawing on conclusions from the Data & Society report Beyond Disruption, Researcher Alexandra Mateescu discusses surveillance of domestic care workers online.

    “Online marketplaces may not be the root cause of individual employers’ biases, but their design is not neutral. They are built with a particular archetype of what an “entrepreneurial” domestic worker looks like—one who feels at home in the world of apps, social media, and online self-branding—and ultimately replicates and can even exacerbate many of the divisions that came with our predigital workplaces. As platform companies gain growing power over the hiring processes of a whole industry, they will need to actively work against the embedded inequalities in the markets they now mediate.”

There’s an App for Wrecking Nannies’ Lives,"In an op-ed for The New York Times, Data & Society Researcher Alex Rosenblat shatters the narrative that Uber encapsulates the entire gig-economy.

    “But this industry has, until recently, operated largely informally, with jobs secured by word-of-mouth. That’s changing, as employers are increasingly turning to Uber-like services to find nannies, housecleaners and other care workers. These new gig economy companies, while making it easier for some people to find short-term work, have created hardships for others, and may leave many experienced care workers behind.”

How Domestic Workers Wager Safety In The Platform Economy,"Data & Society Postdoctoral Scholar Julia Ticona and Data & Society Research Analyst Alexandra Mateescu co-authored an op-ed for Fast Company about the safety of workers who rely on digital platforms to stay employed.

    “For the past year, we’ve been interviewing nannies, babysitters, elder care workers, and housecleaners across the U.S. who use platforms like Handy, TaskRabbit, and the in-home care provider platform Care.com to do care and cleaning work, in an effort to better understand how platforms are shaping domestic work. Along the way, we have found that, in many cases, the aggregation of individual data leads not to more accountability and justice, but rather forces workers to make trade-offs between visibility and vulnerability.”

"Uber May Have Imposed 12-Hour Driving Limits, but It’s Still Pushing Drivers in Other Troubling Ways","Data & Society Researcher Alex Rosenblat unveils the impact of Uber’s new driving limit policy.

    “These moves from Uber and Lyft seem to align with their gig-economy model of employment, which structures work as an individual pursuit and individual liability. But even this sell is misleading. While, for many drivers, the idea of being independent at work is very appealing, their ability to make entrepreneurial decisions is consistently constrained by the ride-hail apps’ nudges and other algorithmic management, rules, external costs, and wage cuts.”

The Network Uber Drivers Built,"In the gig-economy, management by algorithms means employment relationships grow more remote and distributed across the network. Alex Rosenblat explains how workers navigate this by creating their own forums.

    “Online forums aren’t just helping drivers like Cole navigate the challenges of their work, and helping those of us who use and study these platforms grasp those challenges too. They show how as employment relationships grow more remote and distributed across the network, workers can adapt, using technology to forge their own workplace culture.”

Who Cares in the Gig Economy?,"Data & Society Researcher Alexandra Mateescu maps out the inequalities and power dynamics  within the gig economy.

    “As on-demand companies like Handy and online marketplaces like Care.com enter the space of domestic work, a range of questions emerge: what are the risks and challenges of signing up for platform-based work as an immigrant? As a non-native English speaker? How are experiences of work different for individuals with strong professional identities as caregivers or housekeepers, versus more casual workers who may also be finding other kinds of work via Postmates or Uber?”

"Phones, but No Papers","D&S post-doctoral scholar Julia Ticona responds to “Gig Work, Online Selling and Home Sharing” from Pew Research Center.

    Contingent work has always been prevalent in communities where workers have been historically excluded from secure jobs, from union membership, and even from wider public forms of social welfare through systemic forms of discrimination. For these workers, there was no “golden era” of plentiful stable work and a strong social safety net. Despite these long-standing trends, emerging forms of on-demand labor, and the data-driven technologies that workers interact with, can deepen the vulnerabilities of certain populations of workers.

What Customer Data Collection Could Mean for Workers,"D&S affiliate Solon Barocas and D&S fellow Karen Levy examine a concept called refractive surveillance, which is when surveillance of one group impacts another.

    Debates about consumer privacy have largely missed the fact that firms’ ability to develop a better understanding of consumers also impacts workers’ day-to-day experiences, their job security, and their financial well-being.

    But our research suggests that data collection frequently also impacts people other than the those being surveilled. We call this dynamic refractive surveillance. In other words, collecting information about one group can facilitate control over an entirely different group. In our ongoing study, we investigate this dynamic in the context of retail tracking, to understand how data collection about customers can impact how retail workers are managed.

"Library Values & Privacy in our National Digital Strategies: Field guides, Convenings, and Conversations","This report by Data & Society Researcher Bonnie Tijerina and Michael Zimmer is the culmination of gatherings that brought together different privacy practitioners to discuss digital privacy for libraries.

    “While the recent surge in privacy-related activities within the library community is welcome, we see a gap in the conversations we are having about privacy and our digital presence – a knowledge gap, a lack of shared vocabulary, disparate skill sets, and varied understanding. This gap prevents inclusion across the profession and lacks clarity for those responsible for building tools and licensing products.”

Data Privacy Project,"In collaboration with New America, the Brooklyn Public Library, Research Action Design, and the Metropolitan New York Library Council, Data & Society launched The Data Privacy Project to equip library staff with the skills to effectively support patrons around digital privacy and data profiling.

    Seventy-five years after the American Libraries Association pledged to protect patron privacy, the Data Privacy Project helps libraries better prepare individuals and communities for the challenges of always-on, digitally networked, and easily surveilled lifestyles.

    Inspiration for the project began in 2012. Research done in part with collaboration from Brooklyn Public Library found that frontline library staff required training and ongoing support to better respond to patron needs regarding digital privacy or data profiling issues.1 The Data Privacy Project aims to meet that need. With additional training and easy step- by-step resource guides and straightforward training materials, we believe that libraries will be more likely to live up to their professional commitment to protecting patron privacy.

    As the Internet and its usage continue to influence and shape our lives, the issues of digital privacy and data profiling are central to policymaking and public debate. The extent of government surveillance programs, differential treatment of online consumers, and the need for protection of sensitive personal data have increased the urgency of addressing these matters.",https://datasociety.net/output/data-privacy-project/,Report,,,,Libraries and Privacy,,,,Data & Society Research Institute,,Bonnie Tijerina: Bex Hurwitz: Seeta Peña Gangadharan: Nate Hill: Melissa Morrone,,Data Privacy Project,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Campus Support Systems for Technical Researchers Navigating Big Data Ethics,"D&S researcher Bonnie Tijerina offers an overview of the work undertaken by the Supporting Ethics in Data Research project.

    Complex data sets raise challenging ethical questions about risk to individuals who are not sufficiently covered by computer science training, ethics codes, or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). The use of publicly available, corporate, and government data sets may reveal human practices, behaviors, and interactions in unintended ways, creating the need for new kinds of ethical support. Secondary data use invokes privacy and consent concerns. A team at Data & Society recently conducted interviews and campus visits with computer science researchers and librarians at eight U.S. universities to examine the role of research librarians in assisting technical researchers as they navigate emerging issues of privacy, ethics, and equitable access to data at different phases of the research process.

Supporting Ethics in Data Research,"Background: 	

University campuses provide an ecosystem of support to technical researchers, including computer scientists, as they navigate emerging issues of privacy, ethics, security, and consent in big data research. These support systems have varying levels of coordination and may be implicit or explicit.

As part of the Supporting Ethics in Data Research project at Data & Society, we held workshops with twelve to sixteen student researchers,professors, information technology leaders, repository managers, and research librarians at a handful of universities. The goal was to tease out the individual components of ethical, technical, and legal support that were available or absent on each campus, and to better understand the interactions between different actors as they encounter common ethical quandaries.",https://datasociety.net/output/supporting-ethics-in-data-research/,Report,,,,Supporting Ethics in Data Research,,,,Data & Society Research Institute,,Emily Keller: Bonnie Tijerina: danah boyd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D&S fellow Alice Marwick, researcher Claire Fontaine, and president and founder danah boyd examine this question in their study.

    ” Framing online privacy violations as inevitable and widespread may not only help foster activist anger and strategic resistance but also avoid the victim-blaming narratives of some media literacy efforts. By examining the experiences of these young people, who are often left out of mainstream discussions about privacy, we hope to show how approaches to managing the interplay of on- and offline information flows are related to marginalized social and economic positions.”

How Youth Navigate the News Landscape,"D&S researchers Mary Madden, Amanda Lenhart, and Claire Fontaine explore youth news consumption behavior on mobile and social media. It reveals how young people are adapting to a changing media environment to access news they trust. Executive summary is below

    In 2017, what it means to “know what’s going on in the world” has become a hotly contested issue. Years of change and innovations in the journalism industry have radically transformed the way Americans consume, share and even produce their own forms of news. At a deeper level, the public’s eroding trust in journalistic institutions and the rise of a highly politicized networked digital media environment have underscored the urgent need to understand how these disruptions might evolve in the future.",https://datasociety.net/output/how-youth-navigate-the-news-landscape/,Report,,,,Enabling Connected Learning,,,,Data & Society Research Institute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Legacy of inBloom,"D&S researcher Monica Bulger, with Patrick McCormick and D&S research analyst Mikaela Pitcan, writes this working paper detailing the “Legacy of inBloom”.

    Although inBloom closed in 2014, it ignited a public discussion of student data privacy that resulted in the introduction of over 400 pieces of state-level legislation. The fervor over inBloom showed that policies and procedures were not yet where they needed to be for schools to engage in data-informed instruction. Industry members responded with a student data privacy pledge that detailed responsible practice. A strengthened awareness of the need for transparent data practices among nearly all of the involved actors is one of inBloom’s most obvious legacies.

    Instead of a large-scale, open source platform that was a multi-state collaboration, the trend in data-driven educational   technologies since inBloom’s closure has been toward closed, proprietary systems, adopted piecemeal. To date, no large-scale educational technology initiative has succeeded in American K-12  schools. This study explores several factors that contributed to the demise of inBloom and a number of important questions: What were the values and plans that drove inBloom to be designed the way it was? What were the concerns and movements that caused inBloom to run into resistance How has the entire inBloom development impacted the future of edtech and student data?

"Where policy and practice collide: Comparing United States, South African and European Union approaches to protecting children online","D&S researcher Monica Bulger, with Patrick Burton, Brian O’Neill, and Elisabeth Staksrud, writes “Where policy and practice collide: Comparing United States, South African and European Union approaches to protecting children online”.

    That children have a right to protection when they go online is an internationally well-established principle, upheld in laws that seek to safeguard children from online abuse and exploitation. However, children’s own transgressive behaviour can test the boundaries of this protection regime, creating new dilemmas for lawmakers the world over. This article examines the policy response from both the Global North and South to young people’s online behaviour that may challenge adult conceptions of what is acceptable, within existing legal and policy frameworks. It asks whether the ‘childhood innocence’ implied in much protection discourse is a helpful basis for promoting children’s rights in the digital age. Based on a comparative analysis of the emerging policy trends in Europe, South Africa and the United States, the article assesses the implications for policymakers and child welfare specialists as they attempt to redraw the balance between children’s online safety while supporting their agency as digital citizens.

What role do “power learners” play in online learning communities?,"D&S researcher Monica Bulger analyzes how ‘power learners’ utilize and contribute to online learning communities with researchers Cristobal Cabo, Jonathan Bright, and Ryan den Rooljen.

    We propose two fundamental questions related to the role of these users in learning communities, whom we dub “power learners”. 1) Are power learners naturally committed to the learning community, or do they decide to become more involved progressively? Power users typically show high levels of activity from the beginning of their participation [13]; though studies have also suggested that power users can also learn as they develop [14]. Does the same hold true for online education? 2) Are power learners crucial for starting and maintaining online education communities? In other contexts, such as Wikipedia editing, active early involvement of a small mass of committed participants is crucial for starting collective activities [8]. Is this also the case when it comes to online education?

Undoing the neutrality of big data,"    The mythology surrounding “big data” rests on the notion that technical systems can increase efficiency and decrease bias. Such “neutral” systems are supposedly good for implementing legal logic because, like these systems, law relies on binaries in decision-making, removing the gray and fuzzy from the equation. The problem with this formulation is that efficiency is not necessarily desirable, bias is baked into the data sets and reified technically as well as through interpretation, and legal binaries are neither socially productive nor logically sound.

D&S founder danah boyd responds to Margaret Hu’s work in Big Data Blacklisting with supportive arguments that further Hu’s assertions. boyd discusses how procedure and efficiency make algorithmic decision-making so attractive to policymakers and bureaucrats yet flawed systems in place do not make data neutral and in fact ‘blacklists purposefully distance decision-makers from the humanity of those who are being labeled’.

The real component of virtual learning: motivations for face-to-face MOOC meetings in developing and industrialised countries,"D&S researcher Monica Bulger, Jonathan Bright, and Cristóbal Cobo investigate why some Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) users organize face-to-face meetings, exploring the hypothesis that meetup invites would reflect students’ learning goals. They also investigate the extent to which these patterns vary between industrialised and developing countries.

    Abstract: Massive open online courses (MOOCs) offer the possibility of entirely virtual learning environments, with lectures, discussions, and assignments all distributed via the internet. The virtual nature of MOOCs presents considerable advantages to students in terms of flexibility to learn what they want, when they want. Yet despite their virtual focus, some MOOC users also seek to create face-to-face communities with students taking similar courses or using similar platforms. This paper aims to assess the learner motivations behind creation of these offline communities. Do these face-to-face meetings represent an added extra to the learning experience, with students taking advantage of the context of the MOOCs to create new personal and professional connections? Or, are offline meetups filling a gap for students who feel that not all learning can take place online? We also assess the extent to which these patterns vary between developing and industrialised regions, thus testing the claim that MOOCs are helping to democratise access to education around the world. Our research is based on a unique source of socially generated big data, drawn from the website ‘meetup.com’, which gives us a data set of over 4000 MOOC related events taking place in over 140 countries around the world over a two year period. We apply a mixed methods approach to this data, combining large-scale analysis with more in-depth thematic hand coding, to more fully explore the reasons why some learners add a ‘real’ component to their virtual learning experience.

The Myth of Accountability: How Data (Mis)Use is Reinforcing the Problems of Public Education,"In this primer, D&S researcher Claire Fontaine examines the construct of accountability as it functions in discussions around education reform in the American public education system. The paper considers the historic precursors to accountability, as well as the set of political, economic, cultural, and social conditions that led to test scores becoming the main measure of a school’s success.

In addition to the historical context around accountability, the paper considers important questions about who accountability serves, what the incentive structures are, and how accountability is gamed and resisted. In short, accountability of what, to whom, for what ends, at what cost?

Abstract:

    There is an ongoing tension in the American public education system between the values of excellence, equity, and a sustained commitment to efficiency. Accountability has emerged as a framework in education reform that promises to promote and balance all three values. Yet, this frame is often contested due to disagreements over the role of incentives and penalties in achieving desirable change, and concerns that the proposed mechanisms will have significant unintended consequences that outweigh potential benefits. More fundamentally, there is widespread disagreement over how to quantify excellence and equity, if it is even possible to do so. Accountability rhetoric echoes a broader turn toward data-driven decision-making and resource allocation across sectors. As a tool of power, accountability processes shift authority and control away from professional educators and toward policymakers, bureaucrats, and test makers.",https://datasociety.net/output/the-myth-of-accountability-how-data-misuse-is-reinforcing-the-problems-of-public-education/,Report,,,,Enabling Connected Learning,,,,Data & Society Research Institute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I learned about the limits of school choice in New York City from a mother whose child uses a wheelchair,"D&S research Claire Fontaine explores issues around accessibility at NYC schools.

“So for the past six months, I’ve been asking local parents about the data they used to choose among the system’s 1700 or so schools…Beyond the usual considerations like test scores and art programs, they also consider the logistics of commuting from the Bronx to the East Village with two children in tow, whether the school can accommodate parents and children who are still learning English, and how much money the parent-teacher association raises to supplement the school’s budget.

But for some families, the choice process begins and ends with the question: Is the building fully accessible?”

CIPA and Monitoring the Connected Classroom,"In this blogpost, Zachary Gold dives into the implications of the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), launched in 2000.

    “Many parents certainly worry about their children getting access to inappropriate material online, and CIPA may have been a reasonable way to address that concern when it was passed. The devices we use, and the way we use the internet, have changed drastically since then. Updating CIPA, or replacing it to govern these new devices and connections being used by students could do more harm than good. Keeping pornography out of student’s schoolrooms is important, but filtering and monitoring student’s internet activity around town and at home blurs the role of school administrators.”

How to Socially Engineer Voluntary Integration,"D&S researcher Claire Fontaine looks at how school performance data can lead to segregation.

    In our technocratic society, we are predisposed toward privileging the quantitative. So, we need to find ways to highlight what is truly helpful in the data, but also insert an element of creative distrust. We need to encourage data consumers to think deeply about their values, rather than using data to reify knee-jerk prejudicial attitudes.

Student Data & Mental Health: What the Blank Spots Say,"D&S research analyst Mikaela Pitcan discusses how missing data can impact how students with mental health conditions.

    The areas in which data are lacking communicate priorities. However, without concrete data to show a need to prioritize the issue of mental health in schools, there is little incentive to make this issue a priority. Is the failure to account for students with mental illness in a detailed manner the result of stigma? Is it the result of a broader culture that idealizes childhood and is unable to integrate the idea of children struggling with mental illness into our collective consciousness? How might big data be used to identify children in need of mental health treatment in schools to target intervention while protecting students’ privacy? In an age where incredibly detailed information is collected, some students’ needs remain invisible. How can we use the data we have to address the need for the data that is missing?

Accountability: Calling Education to A Count,"In this blogpost, Audrey Watters challenges accountability processes in the current public school system.

    “So when we think about “what counts” and who’s held to account under public education’s accountability regime, it’s still worth asking if accountability can co-exist with “response-ability” — accountable to whom, how and to what ends; responsible to whom, how, and to what ends.”

    Data is great at masking its own embedded bias, and school performance data allows privileged parents to reinforce educational inequality. The best interests of some individuals are optimized at the expense of the society. Accountability programs, particularly when coupled with school choice models, serve to keep middle and upper middle class families invested in public schools, but in an uneven and patterned way, causing segregated school environments to persist despite racial and socioeconomic residential diversity.

    The main problem is that researchers have done a poor job explaining the value of collecting and using student data for educational research. Much of the contributions of research to practice are invisible, especially when they are successful. There are no signposts to flag how early education becomes a priority, or a school starts serving breakfast, or why early-career teachers are paired with veteran mentors. But if there were, the signs might say say this is brought to you by research from xyz, or student data from over 100,000 kids in 45 school districts over a 5-year period have informed this new practice.

    When we believe that we have a monopoly on asking important questions, we do ourselves a disservice. It’s dangerous that we think that basic research starts with the questions we find important rather than trying to understand the knowledge that society is missing. Peer review suggests that we are the only ones who have purchase over whether a study is valuable enough to fund or publish. True impact will never be achieved by trying to keep within an ivory tower. Impact requires being deeply embedded within the social world that we seek to understand and recognizing that the key to success is to inform and empower through knowledge.

Does data-driven learning improve equity?,"Student data can and has served as an equalizer, but it also has the potential to perpetuate discriminatory practices. In order to leverage student data to move toward equity in education, researchers, parents, and educators must be aware of the ways in which data serves to equalize as well as disenfranchise. Common discourse surrounding data as an equalizer can fall along a spectrum of “yes, it’s the fix” or “this will never work.” Reality is more complicated than that.

D&S founder danah boyd offers her thoughts and insight on the emerging battles for the age of online consent across Europe. boyd points out that this is not a new battle- it’s one that may sound triumphant at first take but in reality serves to make teenagers’ lives more difficult and to make vulnerable youth more vulnerable. If economic arguments seem more convincing, boyd encourages thought on how these rules will effect the corporate ecosystem of platforms and social networks operating within the EU.

Is using technology for learning a good idea?,"D&S researcher Monica Bulger introduces better ways to measure edtech usage with children, including the following:

    Ask the children. As part of the demographic data collected by PISA tests, adding questions about use of technology in the classroom would be a stronger and more accurate measure. School administrators might feel pressured to report on ideal use or expected use rather than actual use, but asking an entire cohort of students about their use will likely result in more accurate averages. Further, given the number of classes and teachers at any given school, expecting principals to be aware of specific practices might be unreasonable.

Are We Training Our Students to be Robots?,"In this piece, D&S founder danah boyd considers the interwoven political and social goals of education and, in light of these goals, the different ways one can interpret the personalized learning agenda in education. She also asks us to consider who benefits, and who loses, from a technologically mediated world.

    Just as recommendation systems result in differentiated experiences online, creating dynamics where one person’s view of the internet radically differs from another’s, so too will personalized learning platforms.

    More than anything, what personalized learning brings to the table for me is the stark reality that our society must start grappling with the ways we are both interconnected and differentiated. We are individuals and we are part of networks.

    In the realm of education, we cannot and should not separate these two. By recognizing our interconnected nature, we might begin to fulfill the promises that technology can offer our students.

Spectrum of Trust in Data,"Spectrum of Trust in Data offers a framework for understanding New York City parents’ and guardians’ orientations toward publicly available school data.

Data & Society Researcher Dr. Claire Fontaine and Research Assistant Kinjal Dave performed a qualitative, semi-structured, interview-based study with a socio-economically, racially, and geographically diverse group of 30 New York City parents and guardians between May and November 2017. Interviews focused on experiences of school choice; and data and information sources.

This report illuminates an important gap in common assumptions about the market-driven ecosystem of school choice. Fontaine and Dave find that the data displays produced by the Department of Education (DOE) for parents are for the most part unused, buried on the DOE site, and difficult to comprehend even for those with high information literacy. Instead, parents turn to Google, school websites, and independent school review sites, such as InsideSchools and GreatSchools. Furthermore, the authors find that the information sources that parents favor (InsideSchools and GreatSchools over DOE dashboards) “digest” the data in a way that reinforces the correlation between poverty, minority populations, and low test scores.",https://datasociety.net/output/spectrum-of-trust-in-data/,Report,,,,Data and Equity in School Choice: Enabling Connected Learning,,,,Data & Society Research Institute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Victims Are Not Virtual: Situation assessment of online child sexual exploitation in South Asia,"D&S researchers Mark Latonero and Monica Bulger, with Bronwyn Wex, Emma Day, Kapil Aryal, Mariya Ali, and Keith Hiatt, completed a thorough study on online child sexual exploitation in South aSIA.

    This study identified an assumption that a technical fix must exist for problems identified as ‘online’. In the case of online child sexual exploitation, these assumptions are true, but limited. INTERPOL and the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) lead efforts to identify and take down CSAM images globally, a technological fix. Yet it is a finding of this study that combined with international response there is also a need for a local response to attend to the victims and perpetrators. Local response to online child sexual exploitation relies on the strength of the existing child protection system, locating treatment of abuse incidents regardless of where they occur, within an existing framework. It additionally addresses that a single child may be victim of multiple forms of abuse and seeking treatment from the same facilities.

The Trafficking-Technology Nexus,"Within some public policy and scholarly accounts, human trafficking is increasingly understood as a technological problem that invites collaborative anti-trafficking solutions. A growing cohort of state, non-governmental, and corporate actors in the United States have come together around the shared contention that technology functions as both a facilitator and disrupting force of trafficking, specifically sex trafficking. Despite increased attention to the trafficking-technology nexus, scant research to date has critically unpacked these shifts nor mapped how technology reconfigures anti-trafficking collaborations. In this article, we propose that widespread anxieties and overzealous optimism about technology’s role in facilitating and disrupting trafficking have simultaneously promoted a tri-part anti-trafficking response, one animated by a law and order agenda, operationalized through augmented internet, mobile, and networked surveillance, and maintained through the integration of technology experts and advocates into organized anti-trafficking efforts.

"Tech Companies Should Speak Up for Refugees, Not Only High-Skilled Immigrants","D&S researcher Mark Latonero provides an overview of the role of large tech companies in refugee crises.

    While the 40-page brief is filled with arguments in support of immigration, it hardly speaks about refugees, except to note that those seeking protection should be welcomed. Any multinational company with a diverse workforce would be concerned about limits to international hiring and employee travel. But tech companies should also be concerned about the refugee populations that depend on their digital services for safety and survival.

Tech folk: ‘Move fast and break things’ doesn’t work when lives are at stake,"D&S fellow Mark Latonero considers recent attempts by policymakers, big tech companies, and advocates to address the deepening refugee and migrant crisis and, in particular, the educational needs of displaced children through technology and app development projects. He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.

    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.

    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.

    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities. But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?

Re: “Stakeholder Engagement on Cybersecurity in the Digital Ecosystem”,"Data & Society submitted comments with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in response to their “Request for Comment on Stakeholder Engagement on Cybersecurity in the Digital Ecosystem.”

The digital ecosystem is quickly changing as more services are offered online and as the devices that make up the Internet of Things (IoT) proliferate. We recommended that NTIA’s multistakeholder effort attempt to address, among other things, cybersecurity in the Internet of Things, user notification and choice in regard to data collection, and possible civil liberties dilemmas raised by big data and monitoring by numerous devices and websites.

These concerns about the effects of the Internet of Things on cybersecurity and civil liberties need to be addressed while the ecosystem is young. Failure to consider these questions now could leave users vulnerable to a number of threats in the future. Unless devices and services are adequately secured, users will be vulnerable to breaches that could expose intimate information about their bodies and homes to people who were never given permission to access that data. Additionally, without giving users proper notification and obtaining actual consent, users will be unaware of the privacy risks involved in using these technologies and unable to protect the information they consider private. Finally, data collection by online services and by devices that monitor our bodies and environments could lead to abuses of users’ civil liberties.

Mark Latonero: Data-Driven Tensions in Human Rights,"D&S fellow Mark Latonero spoke at a GovLab Idea Lunch to discuss the complexities of human rights-related data collection.

    Latonero used his last six years of work in investigating cases of online human trafficking as an example of how data driven applications can be used in a human rights context. As individuals have moved to online communication, so too has human trafficking. As a digital ecosystem easily connecting supply and demand within the sex industry emerged, so too have some cases of commercial exploitation of children hidden within online venues such as “classified” sites, like Backpage.

Why big data has some big problems when it comes to public policy,"Excerpt: “[D&S fellow] Mark Latonero, who heads up the University of Southern California’s Technology & Human Trafficking project, spoke about the work his team is doing to try and identify potential victims of human trafficking by analyzing the data of online classified ads and other data sources. It’s potentially very important work, and while some other projects (and Google) are working with law enforcement on similar efforts, Latonero’s group isn’t. This is partially due to the fact that universities typically like to stick to research rather than implementation, but one could also foresee some serious legal challenges to investigations based on data mining rather than evidence or specific complaints.”

"Tech Companies Should Speak Up for Refugees, Not Only High-Skilled Immigrants","D&S researcher Mark Latonero provides an overview of the role of large tech companies in refugee crises.

    While the 40-page brief is filled with arguments in support of immigration, it hardly speaks about refugees, except to note that those seeking protection should be welcomed. Any multinational company with a diverse workforce would be concerned about limits to international hiring and employee travel. But tech companies should also be concerned about the refugee populations that depend on their digital services for safety and survival.

The 18th century enlightenment period gave birth to a self-conscious sense of power and responsibility among people in Europe – together with a few important links to Ben Franklin’s United States – and this proved to be one of the major revolutionary events of the modern era. It can be argued that the World Wide Web, emblematic of our Digital era, embodies the basic Enlightenment ideals of Diderot’s original emblem. At this moment, two decades after the emergence of the Web, we can see changes in our social lives that were impossible to foresee 20 years ago.

National Cyber Leap Year Summit Co-Chairs and Participants Ideas Report,"The Nation’s economic progress and social well-being now depend as heavily on cyberspace assets as on interest rates, roads, and power plants, yet our digital infrastructure and its foundations are still far from providing the guarantees that can justify our reliance on them.  The inadequacy of today’s cyberspace mechanisms to support the core values underpinning our way of life has become a national problem.  To respond to the President’s call to secure our nation’s cyber infrastructure, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the agencies of the Federal Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program have developed the Leap-Ahead Initiative.  NITRD agencies include AHRQ, DARPA, DOE, EPA, NARA, NASA, NIH, NIST, NOAA, NSA, NSF, OSD, and the DOD research labs.) As part of this initiative, the Government in October 2008 launched a National Cyber Leap Year to address the vulnerabilities of the digital infrastructure.  That effort has proceeded on the premise that, while some progress on cybersecurity will be made by finding better solutions for today’s problems, some of those problems may prove to be too difficult.  The Leap Year has pursued a complementary approach: a search for ways to avoid having to solve the intractable problems.  We call this approach changing the game, as in “if you are playing a game you cannot win, change the game!”  ",https://www.nitrd.gov/nitrdgroups/images/b/bd/National_Cyber_Leap_Year_Summit_2009_CoChairs_Report.pdf,paper,academic,,,,,,,Heinz College: Carnegie Mellon University,,Alessandro Acquisti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/papers.htm#TechnicalReports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Teaching Johnny Not to Fall for Phish,"Phishing attacks, in which criminals lure Internet users to websites that spoof legitimate websites,are occurring with increasing frequency and are causing considerable harm to victims. While agreat deal of effort has been devoted to solving the phishing problem by prevention and detectionof phishing emails and phishing websites, little research has been done in the area of trainingusers to recognize those attacks.  Our research focuses on educating users about phishing andhelping them make better trust decisions.  We identified a number of challenges for end-usersecurity education in general and anti-phishing education in particular: users are not motivatedto learn about security; for most users, security is a secondary task; it is difficult to teach people toidentify security threats without also increasing their tendency to misjudge non-threats as threats.Keeping these challenges in mind, we developed an email-based anti-phishing education systemcalled “PhishGuru” and an online game called “Anti-Phishing Phil” that teaches users how touse cues in URLs to avoid falling for phishing attacks. We applied learning science instructionalprinciples in the design of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil. In this paper we present the resultsof PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil user studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of thesetools. Our results suggest that, while automated detection systems should be used as the firstline of defense against phishing attacks, user education offers a complementary approach to helppeople better recognize fraudulent emails and websites.",http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/johnny_paper.pdf,paper,academic,,,,,,,Heinz College: Carnegie Mellon University,,Alessandro Acquisti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/papers.htm#TechnicalReports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What's It To You? A Survey of Online Privacy Concerns and Risks,"Finding information about privacy practices can be difficult: privacy policies often do not present this information in an accessible way. People typically do not know how or for what purpose their personal information, gathered online, will be used. When asked, people frequently express concerns about their privacy, but their behavior often does not reflect their concerns. We conducted an online survey to examine participants' online privacy concerns, focusing especially on the online shopping context. We asked participants about several scenarios related to the privacy of personal information. We found that Privacy Finder, a P3P-enhanced search engine, provides information that addresses the scenarios that participants believe are most likely to occur. We also asked participants about a wide range of items for purchase online to evaluate which types of items are more likely to raise privacy concerns.

Job Creation and Job Destruction in the Russian Federation,"We study Russian job dynamics in transition using micro-level data sets from the December 1996 and June 1997 administrative records of firms in manufacturing, mining, trading and construction, for a pool of representative regions. We show that in 1997 small firms were the most successful at creating jobs while medium and large firms were mainly destroying them. Privatised firms fared no better than state-owned firms whilst de novo private firms had a considerably superior record relative to other firms with respect to job creation. However, much of this superior performance was related to labour market entry.

Grime and Punishment: Job Insecurity and Wage Arrears in the Russian Federation,"The initial years of transition in the Russian federation have been characterised by relatively smaller falls in employment than observed in other reform-orientated countries of Eastern Europe. We show that for many Russian workers, the dominant form of labour market adjustment is instead the delayed receipt of wages. There are large regional variations in the incidence of wage arrears. Workers in the metropolitan centre are significantly less affected by delayed and incomplete wage payments than workers in the provinces. There is less evidence that individual characteristics contribute much toward the incidence of wage arrears, though unobserved heterogeneity has some role to play. Wage arrears are found across the skill distribution. As with the incidence of unemployment, however, there is evidence that the persistence of arrears is concentrated on a subset of the working population. We show that workers can only exercise the exit option of a job quit from a firm paying wages in arrears if the outside labour market is sufficiently dynamic.

Von Neumann's Legacy: 'Intelligent' Capital in a Weightless Economy,"Computers are different from hammers because, unlike hammers, they can operate autonomously, manipulate symbols, and modify themselves. This paper analyzes the factor behind the phenomenon of the de-materialization of advanced economies: combinations of electronic hardware and software; considers their heterogeneity as compared to other forms of capital; and seeks to explain the origins of that heterogeneity. Today's computers are examples of an ""intelligent"" capital--a means of production that actively incorporates human capital in physical forms. Their characteristics derive from developments in computing and automata theory that benefited from John von Neumann's research. On this basis the paper shows that intelligent capital is potentially capable of increasing through a process which does not require investment in the traditional sense, and comments on the relevance of this capacity to economic analysis and the study of advanced, ""weightless"" economies.

Intelligent' vs. Human Capital in the Endogenous/Exogenous Growth Debate,"""Human capital,"" ""ideas"" and ""knowledge"" have been used as interchangeable, almost synonymous terms, representing knowledge-related factors in the neoclassical literature on growth. This paper emphasizes the differences between different forms of knowledge and tests the response of a standard neoclassical model to the treatment of each form as a distinct factor of production. One factor is knowledge in the form of an individual's human capital. It needs to allocate its time between production, accumulation and a non-productive activity (rest or leisure). The second factor represents knowledge incorporated into physical tools, external to those who produced it. This ""intelligent"" capital (traditional capital incorporating human capital) is used in production and accumulation and does not need leisure. A distinction based on the different time constraints of the two factors can produce, under the hypothesis of balanced growth paths, competition between them and force negative rates of accumulation for one of the two ""rival"" factors. Moreover, both the endogenous and the exogenous growth results can be achieved, depending on the preferences of the agents. In particular, a trade-off arises between the endogeneity of the choice of leisure and the endogeneity of growth under admissible (in the sense of King, Plosser, Rebelo 1988) utility functional forms.

"Essays on Privacy, Anonymity, and Tracking in Computer-mediated Economic Transactions","As more organizations and individuals move on-line, concerns for privacy and security of personal information grow and new trade-offs arise. 
Is there a combination of economic incentives and technological solutions to privacy issues that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society? Is there a “sweet spot” that satisfies the interests of all parties? 
This dissertation combines technological and economic analysis to answer these questions. It introduces some of the most challenging technological and economic issues in the debate on privacy of personal information. It proposes cryptographic protocols to protect the privacy and anonymity of individuals in environments such as elections, payments, and recommendation systems. It then highlights novel economic aspects of the use of tracking and privacy-enhancing technologies. 
On the technological side, the dissertation presents a novel method to protect the privacy of individuals through the coordination among parties that do not know each other. In this method, privacy is protected through anonymity, by hiding the identity of an individual completing a certain transaction amidst the identities of many other individuals completing similar transactions. These transactions are completed through a third party that does not need to be trusted. While several applications of this method are possible, this dissertation discusses its embodiment as an anonymous payment system and as an electronic voting and recommendation system. As a payment system, the method allows anonymous payments to be completed while guaranteeing the atomicity of the transaction. As a voting system, the method allows write-in ballots to be receipt-free and universally verifiable.

ISO/IEC Guide 50,"Safety aspects — Guidelines for child safety

This Guide provides a framework for addressing potential sources of unintentional physical harm (hazards) to children from products, processes or services that they use or with which they may come into contact, even if they are not specifically intended for children. The framework aims at minimizing risk of injury to children.

It is primarily intended for those involved in the preparation and revision of standards. However, it has important information that can be useful to, amongst others, designers, architects, manufacturers, service providers, communicators and policy makers.

For children with special needs, additional requirements may be appropriate. This Guide does not claim to address those additional requirements in full. ISO/IEC Guide 71 addresses the neds of persons with disabilities.

A product may include goods, structures, buildings, installations or a combination of these.

ISO_Guide_64_2008(E),"Guide for addressing environmental issues in product standards

Every product has an impact on the environment during all stages of its life-cycle, e.g. extraction of resources, acquisition  of  raw  materials,  production,  distribution,  use  (application),  reuse,  end-of-life  treatment,  including  final  disposal.  These  impacts  range  from  slight  to  significant;  they  can  be  short-term  or  long-term;  and  they  occur  at  global,  regional  or  local  level.  Provisions  in  product  standards  have  an  influence  on  environmental  impacts of products. The  need  to  reduce  the  potential  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment  of  a  product  that  can  occur  during  all  stages  of  its  life  is  recognized  around  the  world.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  products  can  be  reduced by taking into account environmental issues in product standards. This Guide is intended for use by all those involved in the drafting of product standards, to draw attention to environmental  issues  in  support  of  sustainable  international  trade,  and  is  not  intended  to  be  used  to  create  non-tariff barriers to trade. Standards writers are not expected to become environmental experts but, by using this Guide, they are encouraged to: ⎯    identify   and   understand   basic   environmental   aspects   and   impacts   related   to   the   product   under   consideration, and ⎯    determine  when  it  is  possible  and  when  it  is  not  possible  to  deal  with  an  environmental  issue  through  a  product standard. During  the  life-cycle  of  a  given  product,  different  environmental  aspects  can  be  determined.  However,  the  identification  of  these  aspects  and  the  prediction  of  their  impacts  is  a  complex  process.  When  writing  a  product standard, it is important to ensure that an evaluation as to how products can affect the environment at different stages of their life-cycle is carried out as early as possible in the process of developing the standard. The results of this evaluation are important for specifying provisions in standards. It is anticipated that product standards  writers  actively  consider  compliance  with  any  applicable  national,  regional  or  local  product  related  regulation.",https://www.bsigroup.com/contentassets/fb7f1499fa6f43c6b9084be8c2378bc9/iso_guide_64_2008e---guide-for-addressing-environmental-issues-in-product-standards-.pdf,specifications,,,,00_ISO/IEC Directives and Guides Functions: Consumer Standards Resources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.iso.org/consumer-standards-resources.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ISO_Guide_78_2012(E),"Safety of machinery— Rules for drafting and presentation of safety standards

As a response to the increased global trade in machinery, the relevant ISO Technical Committees have undertaken publication of a series of related machinery safety standards. It has thus been necessary to develop rules for the preparation, drafting and presentation of such safety standards, supplementing the ISO/IEC    Directives, Part 2, which sets out general principles and requirements for all International Standards.This Guide provides those rules. It is intended for use by Technical Committees writing type-B and type-C standards in the field of safety of machinery (as defined in 3.2 and 3.3). It both makes use of, and refers to, the principles and concepts established in ISO12100, and also takes into account, as far as possible, ISO/IECGuide51.International Standards prepared according to this Guide are intended as a means for supporting national or regional technical regulations (for example, legislation) for machinery safety according to the principles of UNECE Recommendation L. In order that machinery safety standards be able to support these technical regulations, the drafting of the standards can necessitate compliance with specific requirements additional to this Guide, in as far as any such additional requirements are accepted by ISO as not contradicting the content of this Guide. For example, in order to support European legislation, the Guidelines for the implementation of the agreement on technical co-operation between ISO and CEN (Vienna Agreement) are additionally applicable.",https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/4230450/8389141/ISO_Guide_78_2012%28E%29_%2D_Safety_of_machinery_%2D%2D_Rules_for_drafting_and_presentation_of_safety_standards.pdf?nodeid=8387150&vernum=-2,specifications,,,,00_ISO/IEC Directives and Guides Functions: Consumer Standards Resources: 12 ISO/IEC Guides (English),,,,ISO: IEC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.iso.org/consumer-standards-resources.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important that the views of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are sufficiently considered  during  the  development  of  standards  and  that  standards  aimed  at  large-scale  or  mass  production are not too costly and complex for SMEs to implement.SMEs benefit from standards, however they may have a weaker position in their market because of their dependency on larger competitors, suppliers or customers or they may have to adapt to existing solutions on the market.SMEs are present in the majority of sectors. As do other users, SMEs benefit from the technical expertise of standards in the elaboration of which they may not have been present. Nevertheless, there are also sometimes advantages to being small as they can adapt quickly, can be more flexible and can have smaller overhead.Furthermore, if standards were to take into consideration the SME perspective, considerable benefits would accrue to all the stakeholders involved in standardization.The aim of this Guide is to raise awareness on the issues that may be of importance to SMEs.

Methods for the adoption of International Deliverables other  than  International  Standards  (such  as  Technical  Specifications,  Publicly  Available  Specifications,  Technical  Reports,  Guides,  Technology  Trend  Assessments,  Industry  Technical  Agreements,  International  Workshop  Agreements)  are  given  in  ISO/IEC  Guide  21-2.  Greater  uniformity  in  the  indication  of  both  correspondence and deviations among countries will aid communication, avoid confusion and facilitate trade. 0.2 International   Standards   are   widely   adopted   at   the   regional   or   national   level   and   applied   by   manufacturers,  trade  organizations,  purchasers,  consumers,  testing  laboratories,  authorities  and  other  interested  parties.  Since  these  standards  generally  reflect  the  best  experience  of  industry,  researchers,  consumers and regulators worldwide, and cover common needs in a variety of countries, they constitute one of the important bases for the removal of technical barriers to trade. This has been explicitly acknowledged in the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade of the World Trade Organization (WTO TBT Agreement). It  is  important  that  every  effort  be  made  to  adopt  and  use  International  Standards  as  regional  or  national  standards  and,  consequently,  to  withdraw  conflicting  regional  or  national  standards  as  soon  as  practicable  for  the reasons mentioned above. Only by developing a global approach can the benefits of standardization be fully realized.  However,  full  adoption  may  not  be  practicable  in  all  cases  for  reasons  such  as  regional  or  national  security,  protection  of  human  health  or  safety,  or  protection  of  the  environment,  or  because  of  fundamental  climatic, geographical or technological problems.

Such  deliverables,  which  are  published  by  ISO and/or IEC, include Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications and informative documents such as Technical Reports, Guides, documents resulting from workshops and other deliverables. 0.2 The   identification   of   the   degree   of   correspondence   and   the   adoption   methods   described   in   ISO/IEC  Guide  21-1  apply  to  International  Standards  as  well  as  to  other  deliverables  published  by  ISO  and  IEC.  However,  International  Standards  are  only  to  be  adopted  as  regional  or  national  standards,  that  is  as  deliverables of the same type. International Deliverables other than International Standards should preferably be adopted as regional or national deliverables of the same or a similar type. However, it is also possible to adopt these deliverables as deliverables of another type (e.g. an ISO or IEC Technical Specification may be adopted as a national Technical Specification, but it could also be adopted as a national standard or another deliverable). 0.3 Some  of  the  International  Deliverables  covered  in  this  part  of  ISO/IEC  Guide  21  may  be  withdrawn  and/or replaced after a certain period of time according to specific rules defined by ISO and/or IEC. Standards bodies having adopted these deliverables regionally or nationally should be aware of these rules and should decide either generally or on a case-by-case basis whether they wish to take similar actions if the International Deliverable is withdrawn or replaced. 0.4     Attention  is  drawn  to  the  Introduction  of  ISO/IEC  Guide  21-1:2005,  particularly  in  relation  to  the  importance  of  International  Standards  within  the  framework  of  the  WTO  TBT  Agreement.  International  Deliverables other than International Standards may perform similar functions in reducing technical barriers to trade and thereby facilitating trade.

ISO   (the   International   Organization   for   Standardization)   and   IEC   (the   International   Electrotechnical   Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO   or   IEC   participate   in   the   development   of   International   Standards   through   technical   committees   established  by  the  respective  organization  to  deal  with  particular  fields  of  technical  activity.  ISO  and  IEC  technical  committees  collaborate  in  fields  of  mutual  interest.  Other  international  organizations,  governmental  and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISI/IEC Directives, Part 2. Draft  Guides  adopted  by  the  responsible  Committee  or  Group  are  circulated  to  national  bodies  for  voting.  Publication as a Guide requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. The first edition of this Guide was published by ISO in 1976. It was prepared by the United Nations Economic Commission  for  Europe  (UN/ECE)  in  consultation  with  ISO,  primarily  to  facilitate  the  work  of  the  UN/ECE  aimed  at  removal  of  barriers  to  international  trade  arising  from  lack  of  harmonization  of  standards  or  inadequate international application of standards. The second, thirdandfourth editions of ISO Guide 2 added new terms and definitions in more or less isolated groups, within no overall planned framework. Work on a systematically structured revision was authorized by the ISO Council in 1981 as the principal task of a working group within the ISO Committee on standardization principles (ISO/STACO), including IEC and UN/ECE spokesmen and in cooperation with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC). The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.  Moreover,  ISO  was  publishing  an  increasing  number  of  Guides  on  standardization  policies  and  procedures, several of them in conjunction with IEC.

ISO_IEC_Guide_59_2019(E),"ISO and IEC recommended practices for standardization by national bodies

ISO/IEC GUIDE 59:2019(E)IntroductionStandardization brings technological, economic and societal benefits. Standards help to harmonize technical and other specifications of products and services making industry more efficient and removing barriers to trade.Standards are considered an essential component of the “quality infrastructure”, the system comprising organizations (public and private), policies, relevant legal and regulatory framework and practices which is needed to support and enhance the quality, safety, and sustainable soundness of goods, services and processes.Standards are developed by many bodies, at the national, regional and international levels. Alongside the growth of international trade, technological and societal cooperation, standards bodies have developed procedures and modes of cooperation which are commonly considered to constitute good practices for standards development at all levels. The use of standards is voluntary unless they are cited as requirements in legislation or in legal contracts.The foundations of ISO’s and IEC’s membership and participation models are at the national level. ISO and IEC, together with their national bodies, are responsible for fostering and ensuring coherence and coordination.The ISO and IEC system for standardization is based on collaboration agreements between ISO and IEC and an extensive array of collaboration agreements among regional, national and other standards bodies",https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/4230450/8389141/ISO_IEC_Guide_59_2019%28E%29_%2D_ISO_and_IEC_recommended_practices_for_standardization_by_national_bodies.pdf?nodeid=8388826&vernum=-2,specifications,,,,00_ISO/IEC Directives and Guides Functions: Consumer Standards Resources: 12 ISO/IEC Guides (English),,,,ISO: IEC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.iso.org/consumer-standards-resources.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ISO_IEC_Guide_63_2019(E),"Guide to the development and inclusion of all aspects of safety in International Standards for medical devices

This document provides practical guidance to standards writers on how to include safety aspects in the development of medical device standards, including management system standards related to medical devices. This document is based on risk management principles and ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014 to address the needs of the medical device sector.The concept of safety, as described in this document, is closely related to protecting patients who are the subjects of medical care, as well as those persons who provide the care and other potentially affected persons. Safety is also related to harm to property or the environment.The approach described in this document aims to reduce the risk arising during the life cycle of a medical device, including design, production, distribution, installation, use, service, maintenance, and destruction or disposal. The complete life cycle of a medical device (including both the intended use and the reasonably foreseeable misuse) is considered. The goal is to achieve acceptable risk for people, property and the environment.As different circumstances warrant different approaches to ensuring safety, it is impossible to provide precise requirements and recommendations that apply to every case. Examples of such differences are the development of standards for manufacturers of medical devices and standards for health care providers and institutions. However, this document, when followed on a judicious “use when applicable” basis, will help in developing standards that include aspects of safety which are consistent with the generally acknowledged state of the art.NOTE The term “standard” used throughout this document includes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Reports and Guides developed by ISO or IEC.",https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/4230450/8389141/ISO_IEC_Guide_63_2019%28E%29_%2D_Guide_to_the_development_and_inclusion_of_all_aspects_of_safety_in_International_Standards_for_medical_devices.pdf?nodeid=8387464&vernum=-2,specifications,,,,00_ISO/IEC Directives and Guides Functions: Consumer Standards Resources: 12 ISO/IEC Guides (English),,,,ISO: IEC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.iso.org/consumer-standards-resources.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this Guide is to assist standards developers (e.g. technical committees or working groups) to address accessibility in standards that focus, whether directly or indirectly, on any type of system that people use. It provides guidance for developing and writing appropriate accessibility requirements and recommendations in standards. However, while its intended audience are standards developers, this Guide contains information that can also be useful to other people, such as manufacturers, designers, service providers and educators.The second edition of this Guide, retitled “Guide for addressing accessibility in standards,” builds upon the edition published in 2001, titled “Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities”. This edition takes account of developments in thinking and practice which have taken place since 2001 and takes a more inclusive approach. This edition also sets out to improve the usability and adoption of the Guide itself. This Guide, like its predecessor, is intended to be part of the overall framework that standards bodies can use in their efforts to support the development of systems that suit the needs of diverse users.It is an important goal for the whole of society that all people, regardless of their age, size or ability, have access to the broadest range of systems.

A  statement  of  measurement  uncertainty  is  indispensable  in  judging  the  fitness  for  purpose  of  a  measuredquantity value.  At the greengrocery store the customer would be content if, when buying a kilogram of fruit,the scales gave a value within, say, 2 grams of the fruit’s actual weight.  However, the dimensions of componentsof the gyroscopes within the inertial navigation systems of commercial aircraft are checked by measurement toparts in a million for correct functioning.Measurement uncertainty is a general concept associated with any measurement and can be used in professionaldecision  processes  as  well  as  judging  attributes  in  many  domains,  both  theoretical  and  experimental.   Asthe tolerances applied in industrial production become more demanding, the role of measurement uncertaintybecomes  more  important  when  assessing  conformity  to  these  tolerances.   Measurement  uncertainty  plays  acentral role in quality assessment and quality standards.Measurement is present in almost every human activity, including but not limited to industrial,  commercial,scientific, healthcare, safety and environmental.

ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008 is a reissue of the 1995 version of the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), with minor corrections. This Guide establishes general rules for evaluating and expressing uncertainty in measurement that can be followed at various levels of accuracy and in many fields — from the shop floor to fundamental research. The principles of this Guide are intended to be applicable to a broad spectrum of measurements, including those required for:

    maintaining quality control and quality assurance in production;
    complying with and enforcing laws and regulations;
    conducting basic research, and applied research and development, in science and engineering;
    calibrating standards and instruments and performing tests throughout a national measurement system in order to achieve traceability to national standards;
    developing, maintaining, and comparing international and national physical reference standards, including reference materials.

ISO_IEC_Guide_98-4_2012(E),"Uncertainty of measurement -- Part 4, Role of measurement uncertainty in conformity assessment

Conformity assessment(see 3.3.1), as broadly defined, is any activity undertaken to determine, directly or indirectly,whether a product, process, system, person or body meets relevant standards and fulfillsspecified  requirements(see3.3.3).   ISO/IEC  17000:2004  gives  general  terms  and  definitions  relating  to  conformity  assessment,  including  theaccreditation of conformity assessment bodies and the use of conformity assessment in facilitating trade.In a particular kind of conformity assessment, sometimes calledinspection(see 3.3.2), the determination that a productfulfils a specified requirement relies on measurement as a principal source of information.  ISO 10576-1:2003 [22] setsout guidelines for checking conformity with specified limits in the case where aquantity(see 3.2.1) is measured and aresultingcoverage interval(see 3.2.7) (termed ‘uncertainty interval’ in ISO 10576-1:2003) is compared with atoleranceinterval(see 3.3.5). The present document extends this approach to include explicit consideration of risks, and developsgeneral procedures for deciding conformity based onmeasurement  results(see 3.2.5), recognizing the central role ofprobability distributions(see 3.1.1) as expressions of uncertainty and incomplete information.The evaluation of measurement uncertainty is a technical problem whose solution is addressed by JCGM 100:2008,theGuide  to  the  expression  of  uncertainty  in  measurement(GUM), and by and its Supplements,  JCGM 101:2008,JCGM 102:2011 and JCGM 103 [3].

ISO_IEC_Guide_99_2007_(Bilingual),"International vocabulary of metrology -- Basic and general conceptsand associated terms (VIM)

In general, a vocabulary is a “terminological dictionary which contains designations and definitions from one or more  specific  subject  fields”  (ISO  1087-1:2000,  3.7.2).  The  present  Vocabulary  pertains  to  metrology,  the  “science  of  measurement  and  its  application”.  It  also  covers  the  basic  principles  governing  quantities  and  units. The field of quantities and units could be treated in many different ways. Clause 1 of this Vocabulary is one  such  treatment,  and  is  based  on  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  ISO  31,  Quantities  and  units,  currently  being  replaced  by  ISO  80000  and  IEC  80000  series  Quantities  and  units,  and  in  the  SI Brochure, The International System of Units (published by the BIPM). The  second  edition  of  the  International  vocabulary  of  basic  and  general  terms  in  metrology  (VIM)  was  published in 1993. The need to cover measurements in chemistry and laboratory medicine for the first time, as well  as  to  incorporate  concepts  such  as  those  that  relate  to  metrological  traceability,  measurement  uncertainty,  and  nominal  properties,  led  to  this  third  edition.  Its  title  is  now  International  vocabulary  of  metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM),in order to emphasize the primary role of concepts in developing a vocabulary. In  this  Vocabulary,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in  the  basic  principles  of  measurement  in  physics,  chemistry,  laboratory  medicine,  biology,  or  engineering.  Furthermore,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  meet  conceptual  needs  of  measurement  in  fields  such  as  biochemistry,  food  science,  forensic science, and molecular biology.

An Empirical Analysis of Data Deletion and Opt-Out Choices on 150 Websites,"Fifteenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS 2019), Aug 2019

Many websites offer visitors privacy controls and opt-out choices, either to comply with legal requirements or to address consumer privacy concerns. The way these control mechanisms are implemented can significantly affect individuals’ choices and their privacy outcomes. We present an extensive content analysis of a stratified sample of 150 English-language websites, assessing the usability and interaction paths of their data deletion options and opt-outs for email communications and targeted advertising. This heuristic evaluation identified substantial issues that likely make exercising these privacy choices on many websites difficult and confusing for US-based consumers. Even though the majority of analyzed websites offered privacy choices, they were located inconsistently across websites. Furthermore, some privacy choices were rendered unusable by missing or unhelpful information, or by links that did not lead to the stated choice. Based on our findings, we provide insights for addressing usability issues in the end-to-end interaction required to effectively exercise privacy choices and controls.",https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2019/presentation/habib,paper,,,,Usable Privacy Policy - Publications,,,,The Usable Privacy Policy Project,,Hana Habib: Yixin Zou: Aditi Jannu: Neha Sridhar: Chelse Swoopes: Alessandro Acquisti: Lorrie Faith Cranor: Norman Sadeh: Florian Schaub,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://usableprivacy.org/publications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Natural Language Processing for Mobile App Privacy Compliance,"AAAI Spring Symposium on Privacy Enhancing AI and Language Technologies (PAL 2019), Mar 2019

Many Internet services collect a flurry of data from theirusers. Privacy policies are intended to describe the ser-vices’  privacy  practices.  However,  due  to  their  lengthand complexity, reading privacy policies is a challengefor  end  users,  government  regulators,  and  companies.Natural language processing holds the promise of help-ing  address  this  challenge.  Specifically,  we  focus  oncomparing the practices described in privacy policies tothe practices performed by smartphone apps covered bythose policies. Government regulators are interested incomparing apps to their privacy policies in order to de-tect non-compliance with laws, and companies are in-terested for the same reason.We  frame  the  identification  of  privacy  practice  state-ments  in  privacy  policies  as  a  classification  problem,which we address with a three-tiered approach: a pri-vacy  practice  statement  is  classified  based  on  a  datatype (e.g., location), party (i.e., first or third party), andmodality (i.e., whether a practice is explicitly describedas being performed or not performed).

Challenges in Automated Question Answering for Privacy Policies,"AAAI Spring Symposium on Privacy Enhancing AI and Language Technologies (PAL 2019), Mar 2019

Privacy  policies  are  legal  documents  used  to  inform  usersabout  the  collection  and  handling  of  their  data  services  ortechnologies with which they interact. Research has shownthat few users take the time to read these policies, as they areoften long and difficult to understand. In addition, users oftenonly care about a small subset of issues discussed in privacypolicies, and some of the issues they actually care about maynot even be addressed in the text of the policies. Rather thanrequiring users to read the policies, a better approach might beto allow them to simply ask questions about those issues theycare about, possibly through iterative dialog. In this work, wetake a step towards this goal by exploring the idea of an au-tomated privacy question-answering assistant, and look at thekinds of questions users are likely to pose to such a system.This analysis is informed by an initial study that elicits pri-vacy questions from crowdworkers about the data practicesof mobile apps. We analyze 1350 questions posed by crowd-workers  about  the  privacy  practices  of  a  diverse  cross  sec-tion of mobile applications. This analysis sheds some lighton privacy issues mobile app users are likely to inquire aboutas well as their ability to articulate questions in this domain.Our findings in turn should help inform the design of futureprivacy question answering systems.",https://usableprivacy.org/static/files/ravichander_pal_2019.pdf,paper,,,,Usable Privacy Policy - Publications,,,,The Usable Privacy Policy Project,,Abhilasha Ravichander: Alan Black: Eduard Hovy: Joel Reidenberg: N.

"Trustworthy Privacy Indicators: Grades, Labels, Certifications and Dashboards","Washington University Law Review, 96, 6, Feb 2019

Despite numerous groups’ efforts to score, grade, label, and rate the privacy of websites, apps, and network-connected devices, these attempts at privacy indicators have, thus far, not been widely adopted. Privacy policies, however, remain long, complex, and impractical for consumers. Communicating in some short-hand form, synthesized privacy content is now crucial to empower internet users and provide them more meaningful notice, as well as nudge consumers and data processors toward more meaningful privacy. Indeed, on the basis of these needs, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as lawmakers and policymakers in the European Union, have advocated for the development of privacy indicator systems.",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3342747,paper,,,,Usable Privacy Policy - Publications,,,,The Usable Privacy Policy Project,,Reidenberg: Joel R. and Russell: N.

APIs and Your Privacy,"Application programming interfaces, or APIs, have been the topic of much recent discussion. Newsworthy events, including those involving Facebook’s API and Cambridge Analytica obtaining information about millions of Facebook users, have highlighted the technical capabilities of APIs for prominent websites and mobile applications. At the same time, media coverage of ways that APIs have been misused has sparked concern for potential privacy invasions and other issues of public policy. This paper seeks to educate consumers on how APIs work and how they are used within popular websites and mobile apps to gather, share, and utilize data.APIs are used in mobile games, search engines, social media platforms, news and shopping websites, video and music streaming services, dating apps, and mobile payment systems. If a third-party company, like an app developer or advertiser, would like to gain access to your information through a website you visit or a mobile app or online service you use, what data might they obtain about you through APIs and how? This report analyzes 11 prominent online services to observe general trends and provide you an overview of the role APIs play in collecting and distributing information about consumers. For example, how might your data be gathered and shared when using your Facebook account login to sign up for Venmo or to access the Tinder dating app? How might advertisers use Pandora’s API when you are streaming music?

Analyzing Privacy Policies at Scale: From Crowdsourcing to Automated Annotations,"ACM Transactions on the Web, 13, 1, Dec 2018

Website privacy policies are often long and difficult to understand. While research shows that Internet userscare about their privacy, they do not have the time to understand the policies of every website they visit,and most users hardly ever read privacy policies. Some recent efforts have aimed to use a combination ofcrowdsourcing, machine learning, and natural language processing to interpret privacy policies at scale, thusproducing annotations for use in interfaces that inform Internet users of salient policy details. However,little attention has been devoted to studying the accuracy of crowdsourced privacy policy annotations, howcrowdworker productivity can be enhanced for such a task, and the levels of granularity that are feasible forautomatic analysis of privacy policies. In this article, we present a trajectory of work addressing each of thesetopics. We include analyses of crowdworker performance, evaluation of a method to make a privacy-policyoriented task easier for crowdworkers, a coarse-grained approach to labeling segments of policy text withdescriptive themes, and a fine-grained approach to identifying user choices described in policy text. Together,the results from these efforts show the effectiveness of using automated and semi-automated methods forextracting from privacy policies the data practice details that are salient to Internet users’ interests",https://usableprivacy.org/static/files/swilson_tweb_2018.pdf,paper,,,,Usable Privacy Policy - Publications,,,,The Usable Privacy Policy Project,,Shomir Wilson: Florian Schaub: Frederick Liu: Kanthashree Mysore Sathyendra: Daniel Smullen: Sebastian Zimmeck: Rohan Ramanath: Peter Story: Fei Liu: Norman Sadeh: Noah A.

Polisis: Automated Analysis and Presentation of Privacy Policies Using Deep Learning,"Privacy policies are the primary channel through which companies inform users about their data collection and sharing practices. These policies are often long and difficult to comprehend. Short notices based on information extracted from privacy policies have been shown to be useful but face a significant scalability hurdle, given the number of policies and their evolution over time. Companies, users, researchers, and regulators still lack usable and scalable tools to cope with the breadth and depth of privacy policies. To address these hurdles, we propose an automated framework for privacy policy analysis (Polisis). It enables scalable, dynamic, and multi-dimensional queries on natural language privacy policies. At the core of Polisis is a privacy-centric language model, built with 130K privacy policies, and a novel hierarchy of neural-network classifiers that accounts for both high-level aspects and fine-grained details of privacy practices. We demonstrate Polisis' modularity and utility with two applications supporting structured and free-form querying. The structured querying application is the automated assignment of privacy icons from privacy policies. With Polisis, we can achieve an accuracy of 88.4% on this task. The second application, PriBot, is the first freeform question-answering system for privacy policies. We show that PriBot can produce a correct answer among its top-3 results for 82% of the test questions. Using an MTurk user study with 700 participants, we show that at least one of PriBot's top-3 answers is relevant to users for 89% of the test questions.

Privacy policies notify Internet users about the privacy practices of websites,  mobile apps,  andother products and services. However, users rarely read them and struggle to understand their con-tents. Also, the entities that provide these policies are sometimes unmotivated to make them com-prehensible.  Recently, annotated corpora of privacy policies have been introduced to the researchcommunity.   They open the door to the development of machine learning and natural languageprocessing techniques to automate the annotation of these documents.  In turn, these annotationscan be passed on to interfaces (e.g., web browser plugins) that help users quickly identify and un-derstand relevant privacy statements. We present advances in extracting privacy policy paragraphs(termedsegmentsin this paper) and individual sentences that relate to expert-identified categoriesof policy contents, using methods in supervised learning. In particular, we show that relevant seg-ments and sentences can be classified with average micro-F1 scores of 0.78 and 0.66 respectively,improving over prior work.  We discuss how the techniques introduced in this paper have beenused to automatically annotate the text of about 7,000 privacy policies.

Which Apps have Privacy Policies?,"Carnegie Mellon University Technical Report CMU-ISR-18-100R, Institute for Software Research, School of Computer Science, Feb 2018

Smartphone app privacy policies are intended to describe smartphone apps’ data collection anduse practices. However, not all apps have privacy policies. Without prominent privacy policies, itbecomes more difficult for users, regulators, and privacy organizations to evaluate apps’ privacypractices. This study shines light on the distribution of privacy policies in the Android ecosystem.We answer the question: “Which apps have privacy policies?”  by analyzing the metadata of overone million apps from the Google Play Store.  Only about half of the apps we examined link to apolicy from their Play Store pages.  First, we conducted an exploratory data analysis of the rela-tionship between app metadata features and whether apps link to privacy policies.  We found thatonly 55.3% of apps rated as suitable for Everyone 10+ link to privacy policies. While this findingrequires further investigation, it suggests that a number of apps might not be compliant with theChildren’s Online Privacy Protection Act.  Next, we trained a logistic regression model to predictthe probability that individual apps will have policy links. Using the model, we explore which appfeatures are most influential for this determination. We find that apps with more ratings and in-apppurchases are associated with greater odds of having links to privacy policies. In contrast, apps inGoogle Play’s “Books and Reference” category or with the “Sexual Themes” content descriptorwere associated with lower odds of having policy links.  Regulators might use this informationto focus their enforcement actions towards areas that are particularly prone to the lack of policylinks.  Alternatively, regulators could use our model to identify apps for which it is particularlyunusual that they do not have policy links.  According to our model, it is unusual for apps withmore than 100,000 ratings and millions of downloads to not link to privacy policies, yet such appsare present on the Play Store. Finally, by comparing three crawls of the Play Store, we observe anoverall-increase in the percent of apps with links between September 2017 and May 2018 (from41.7% to 51.8%). This increase could be associated with a Play Store purge performed by Googleto eliminate or hide apps which collected “Personal and Sensitive Information” but did not havelinks to privacy policies.",https://usableprivacy.org/static/files/CMU-ISR-18-100R.pdf,paper,,,,Usable Privacy Policy - Publications,,,,The Usable Privacy Policy Project,,Peter Story: Sebastian Zimmeck: Norman Sadeh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://usableprivacy.org/publications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PrivOnto: A Semantic Framework for the Analysis of Privacy Policies,"Semantic Web, 9, 2, Jan 2018

Privacy policies are intended to inform users about the collection and use of their data by websites, mobile apps and other services or appliances they interact with. This also includes informing users about any choices they might have regarding such data practices. However, few users read these often long privacy policies; and those who do have difficulty understanding them, because they are written in convoluted and ambiguous language. A promising approach to help overcome this situation revolves around semi-automatically annotating policies, using combinations of crowdsourcing, machine learning and natural language processing. In this article, we introduce PrivOnto, a semantic framework to represent annotated privacy policies. PrivOnto relies on an ontology developed to represent issues identified as critical to users and/or legal experts. PrivOnto has been used to analyze a corpus of over 23,000 annotated data practices, extracted from 115 privacy policies of US-based companies. We introduce a collection of 57 SPARQL queries to extract information from the PrivOnto knowledge base, with the dual objective of (1) answering privacy questions of interest to users and (2) supporting researchers and regulators in the analysis of privacy policies at scale. We present an interactive online tool using PrivOnto to help users explore our corpus of 23,000 annotated data practices. Finally, we outline future research and open challenges in using semantic technologies for privacy policy analysis.

Helping Users Understand Privacy Notices with Automated Question Answering Functionality: An Exploratory Study,"Carnegie Mellon University Technical Report CMU-ISR-17-114R and CMU-LTI-17-005, Institute for Software Research and Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, Dec 2017

Privacy  notices  are  the  default  mechanism  used  to  inform  users  about  the  datacollection and use practices of technologies (e.g., websites, mobile apps, Internet ofThings devices) and processes with which they interact.  The length of these policiesand their often convoluted language have been shown to discourage most users fromreading them.  Recent progress in natural language processing and machine learninghas opened the door to the development of technologies that are capable of automati-cally extracting statements (or “annotations”) from the text of privacy policies.  Thesetechnologies could help users quickly identify those elements of a privacy notice theycare about - without requiring them to read the full text of the notice.In  this  article,  we  review  the  requirements  associated  with  the  development  ofQuery Answering functionality that would enable users to ask questions about spe-cific aspects of privacy notices (e.g. Does this app share my location with third parties?Am I able to review the information this website collects about me?  Can I delete myaccount?   For how long is my information going to be retained by this company?).We  discuss  different  possible  approaches  to  supporting  such  functionality  and  howthey relate to recent advances in automatically annotating privacy notices.  Initial re-sults obtained with different machine learning/natural language processing techniquesare presented, suggesting that Query Answering functionality could be a particularlypromising approach to informing users about privacy practices.  In particular, in con-trast to automated annotation techniques that aim to extract detailed statements fromthe text of privacy notices, Query Answering functionality could be configured to re-turn short text fragments extracted from privacy notices and rely on the user (ratherthan the computer) to interpret some of the finer nuances of the text found in thesefragments. Such an approach could potentially prove more robust than fully automatedannotation techniques,  which at least at this time struggle with the interpretation offiner nuances.",https://usableprivacy.org/static/files/CMU-ISR-17-114R.pdf,paper,,,,Usable Privacy Policy - Publications,,,,The Usable Privacy Policy Project,,Kanthashree Mysore Sathyendra: Abhilasha Ravichander: Peter Garth Story: Alan W Black: Norman Sadeh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://usableprivacy.org/publications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying the Provision of Choices in Privacy Policy Text,"Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Copenhagen, Denmark, Sep 2017

Websites’ and mobile apps’ privacy poli-cies,  written  in  natural  language,  tend  tobe long and difficult to understand.  Infor-mation  privacy  revolves  around  the  fun-damental  principle  ofnotice  and  choice,namely the idea that users should be ableto  make  informed  decisions  about  whatinformation  about  them  can  be  collectedand  how  it  can  be  used.    Internet  userswant  control  over  their  privacy,  but  theirchoices are often hidden in long and con-voluted privacy policy documents.

Increasing the Salience of Data Use Opt-Outs Online,"SOUPS ’17: Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, USENIX, Jul 2017 Poster

rior work has shown that many individuals are concernedabout their privacy but feel resigned with respect to theirabilities to manage or protect their privacy. At the sametime, individuals may not be aware of privacy choices thatare available to them. For instance, many privacy policiescontain links that allow users to opt out of certain data usepractices, such as the use or sharing of contact informa-tion for marketing purposes. We propose a method to makesuch privacy choices more salient to Internet users. Basedon an approach to automatically identify and classify opt-out choices in privacy policies, we designed a browser ex-tension that notifies users about available opt-out choiceson the websites they visit. The goal of our work is to notonly make users aware of available choices but also make iteasier for them to utilize those choices",https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/soups17_poster_nisai.pdf,paper,,,,Usable Privacy Policy - Publications,,,,The Usable Privacy Policy Project,,N.

"Mobile App Privacy Compliance: Automated Technology to Help Regulators, App Stores and Developers","SOUPS ’17: Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, USENIX, Jul 2017 Poster

Mobile apps have to satisfy various privacy requirements.Notably, app publishers are often obligated to provide a pri-vacy policy and notify users of their apps’ privacy practices.But how can a user tell whether an app behaves as its policypromises? In this study we are introducing a scalable systemto analyze and predict Android apps’ compliance with pri-vacy requirements. We report on our collaboration with threeregulatory agencies. We present analysis results for 17,991apps. We expect to soon be able to support app store-wideanalysis (i.e., over a million apps) and to track changes innon-compliant behavior over time.

A Data Purpose Case Study of Privacy Policies,"25th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference, RE:Next! Track, Lisbon, Portugal, Jun 2017

Privacy laws and international privacy standards require that companies collect only the data they have a stated purpose for, called collection limitation. Furthermore, these regimes prescribe that companies will not use data for purposes other than the purposes for which they were collected, called use limitation, except for legal purposes and when the user provides consent. To help companies write better privacy requirements that embody the use limitations and collection limitation principles, we conducted a case study to identify how purpose is expressed among five privacy policies from the shopping domain. Using content analysis, we discovered six exclusive data purpose categories. In addition, we observed natural language patterns to express purpose. Finally, we found that data purpose specificity varies with the specificity of information type descriptions. We believe this taxonomy and the patterns can help policy analysts discover missing or underspecified purposes to better comply with the collection and use limitation principles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8049146,paper,,,,Usable Privacy Policy - Publications,,,,The Usable Privacy Policy Project,,Jaspreet Bhatia: Travis D.

An Evaluation of Constituency-based Hyponymy Extraction from Privacy Policies,"25th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE'17), Lisbon, Portugal, Jun 2017

Requirements analysts can model regulated data practices to identify and reason about risks of non-compliance. If terminology is inconsistent or ambiguous, however, these models and their conclusions will be unreliable. To study this problem, we investigated an approach to automatically construct an information type ontology by identifying information type hyponymy in privacy policies using Tregex patterns. Tregex is a utility to match regular expressions against constituency parse trees, which are hierarchical expressions of natural language clauses, including noun and verb phrases. We discovered the Tregex patterns by applying content analysis to 30 privacy policies from six domains (shopping, telecommunication, social networks, employment, health, and news.) From this dataset, three semantic and four lexical categories of hyponymy emerged based on category completeness and word-order. Among these, we identified and empirically evaluated 72 Tregex patterns to automate the extraction of hyponyms from privacy policies. The patterns match information type hyponyms with an average precision of 0.72 and recall of 0.74.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8049137,paper,,,,Usable Privacy Policy - Publications,,,,The Usable Privacy Policy Project,,M.

Automated Analysis of Privacy Requirements for Mobile Apps,"NDSS'17: Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, Feb 2017

Abstract—Mobile apps have to satisfy various privacy require-ments.  Notably,  app  publishers  are  often  obligated  to  provide  aprivacy  policy  and  notify  users  of  their  apps’  privacy  practices.But  how  can  a  user  tell  whether  an  app  behaves  as  its  policypromises?  In  this  study  we  introduce  a  scalable  system  to  helpanalyze   and   predict   Android   apps’   compliance   with   privacyrequirements.  We  discuss  how  we  customized  our  system  in  acollaboration with the California Office of the Attorney General.Beyond its use by regulators and activists our system is also meantto  assist  app  publishers  and  app  store  owners  in  their  internalassessments of privacy  requirement  compliance.Our analysis of 17,991 free Android apps shows the viabilityof combining machine learning-based privacy policy analysis withstatic code analysis of apps. Results suggest that 71% of apps thatlack  a  privacy  policy  should  have  one.  Also,  for  9,050  apps  thathave a policy, we find many instances of potential inconsistenciesbetween  what  the  app  policy  seems  to  state  and  what  the  codeof  the  app  appears  to  do.  In  particular,  as  many  as  41%  ofthese  apps  could  be  collecting  location  information  and  17%could be sharing such with third parties without disclosing so intheir policies. Overall, each app exhibits a mean of 1.83 potentialprivacy  requirement  inconsistencie",https://usableprivacy.org/files/news/NDSS17.pdf,paper,,,,Usable Privacy Policy - Publications,,,,The Usable Privacy Policy Project,,S.

Digital Strip Searches: The police’s data investigations of victims (July 2019),"The widespread use of mobile phones and other digital devices in people’s everyday lives means we increasingly leave a data trail everywhere we go. Our digital footprints can reveal where we have been and when, who we have spoken to, the  content  of  our  private  conversations  and,  via  our  internet  history,  even  some  of  our  innermost thoughts.More  and  more,  such  data  is  being  sought  in  criminal  investigations.  Clearly,  data  from  devices can be highly relevant to investigations, particularly if the offence involves digital communications. But our research has revealed that police are seeking masses of personal data by default that is not relevant to an investigation at all, and may not be lawful.The  scale  and  depth  of  the  police’s  mobile  phone  searches  are  incomparable  with  the  police’s  legislative  powers  to  carry  out  physical  searches.  It  would  amount  to  police  searching someone’s property and taking copies of all photographs, documents, letters, films, albums, books and files.These  would  be  intrusive  searches  even  for  most  suspects  of  crime.

The State of Surveillance 2018,"The  extraordinary  scale  of  surveillance  in  2018  Britain  affects  all  of  us.  Privacy  is  fast  becoming  a  relic  of  the  pre-internet  age.  We  live  in  a  time  where  our  every  step  can  be,  and  often  is,  recorded.  Whilst  the  world's  largest  companies  are  profiting  from  tracking,  analysing  and  quantifying  every 'consumer', the state is building the most totalitarian style surveillance regime  of  any  democracy  in  history  under  the  Investigatory  Powers  Act  2016.We have long warned of the harms of omnipresent surveillance to society as a whole - and this year, the risk that constant data collection poses to our democracy finally caused public concern after the Cambridge Analytical scandal. However, for some groups, the harms of normalised pervasive and intrusive monitoring practices are particularly tangible. This  report  tells  the  experiences  of  those  groups.  It  tells  the  stories  of  campaigners  and  unionists  who  are  targeted  by  state  surveillance  simply  for engaging in peaceful protest; of people too scared to access healthcare because   of   insidious   government   data   sharing   schemes;   of   welfare   recipients afraid to reap the benefits of social media for fear their posts will be used against them.",https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-State-of-Surveillance-in-2018.pdf,Report,government,,,Research & Briefings,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FaceOff: The Lawless Growth of Facial Recognition in UK Policing (2018),"Facial recognition has long been feared as a feature of a future authoritarian society, with its potential to turn CCTV cameras into identity checkpoints, creating a world where citizens are intensively watched and tracked.However,  facial  recognition  is  now  a  reality  in  the  UK  –  despite  the  lack  of  any  legal  basis  or  parliamentary  scrutiny,  and  despite  the  significant  concerns  raised  by  rights  and  race  equality  groups.  This  new  technology  poses  an  unprecedented  threat  to  citizens’  privacy  and  civil  liberties,  and  could fundamentally undermine the rights we enjoy in public spaces.Police forces in the UK have rolled out automatic facial recognition at a pace unlike any other democratic nation in the world. Leicestershire Police, South Wales Police and the Metropolitan Police have deployed this technology at shopping centres, festivals, sports events, concerts, community events – and even a peaceful demonstration. One police force even used the surveillance tool to keep innocent people with mental health issues away from a public event. In this report, we explain how facial recognition technology works, how it is being used by police in the UK, and how it risks reshaping our rights.",https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Face-Off-final-digital-1.pdf,Report,government,,,Research & Briefings,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cyber attacks in local authorities (2018),"Local  authorities  are holding  ever-expandingtrovesof  personal  information  about  citizens. Under  the  banner  of  data-driven government,  they  are  seeking  to  actively  gather  more information  about  people.

The number  of  serious  cyberattacks isforecasted  to  significantly  rise  in  the  near  future, making cybersecurityrisks a clear priority.But is cybersecurity being appropriately prioritised by local authorities, or is more data collection themain focus of theirdigital strategies?Based on  Freedom of Information  requests,Big  Brother  Watchfound  thatUK local authorities have experiencedin excess of98 million cyberattacks over 5 years.This meansthat there are at least37 attempted breachesof UK local authoritiesevery minute.

Police Access to Digital Evidence (2017),"Police Access to Digital Evidencereveals that 93% of UK police forces are extracting data from digital devices includingmobile phones, laptops, tablets and computers which are seized as evidence from suspects, victims and witnesses.As  mobile  phones  and  other connected  devices  are  now  ubiquitous,it  should  come  as  no  surprise that such technologies can play a significant role in committing or assisting a crime. The data held on digital  devicescan give a detailed insight into people’s lives, communications, contacts,  friends, family  and  acquaintances. Extracting  and  interrogating  evidence such  aslocation  data,  photos, messages  or  internet  searches  can  therefore  be  beneficial  in  assisting  the  police  with  criminalinvestigations.Nevertheless, whilst the investigation of crime is important, ensuring that the lawis comprehensive and up to date is equally important.Based on Freedom of Information requests andresearch we have conducted, we are concerned that the  seizure  of  devices  and  extraction  of  digital  evidence  is  being  undertaken  using laws that  were established  in  a  pre-digital  age.

"Smile you’re on Body Worn Camera, Part 2 – Police (2017)","Smile you’re on Body Worn Camera Part II -Policerevealsfor the first time the investment police in the UK have made in equipping frontline officers with body worn cameras. Since   2010   thepolice, Crown   Prosecution   Service(CPS)and   politicians haveenthusiastically promotedthe roll out ofbody worn cameras.

"Smile you are on Body Worn Camera, Part 1 – Local Authorities (2017)","Big Brother Watch has a long history of exposing the over-zealous use of surveillance powers by local authorities.Over the past 8 years we have found that local authorities have used counter terrorism powers to spy on dog owners, suspected fly tippers and even members of staff they employ to spot crime.  We have revealed the thousands of officials able to enter our homes; often without a warrant, and we have lain bare the financial burden of CCTV on council coffers.  Now in Smile you are on Body Worn Camera, Part 1 –Local Authorities, we reveal for the first time that: 54%of all localauthorities across the UK are equipping members of staff or contractors with body worn cameras at a cost of £1,791,960.81.66%of local authorities are failing to completing Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) before deploying the technology and21% of councils are holding non-evidential footage for longer than 31 days; the time limit adhered to by police forces.Body worn cameras are the new tool in the surveillance arsenal. They can be deployed for multiple purposes often with little to no evidence thatthey are the right tool to solve the particular problem.  Big Brother Watch is concerned that the rush to use body worn cameras by local authorities is not being scrutinised closely enough. When we consider that many councils have a poor track records of using heavy handed surveillance tactics and are often lackadaisical with their approach to protecting personal data, scrutiny of new capabilities should be a number one priority.

Classroom Management Software – Another Brick in the Wall?,"Unless you are a teacher or have a child in school, it is likely you are not familiar with a modern classroom.  Your memories of school may be of chalk boards and scribbling down lessons in a workbook.  Answering a question meant putting your hand up, whilst talking to a friend, or enemy, was done by scrawling on scraps of paper.  Information came from books and encyclopaedias not theinternet, in fact the only time you may have used a computer was in a specific information technology lesson and even then there weren’t enough computers for every student to have a go. That vision of school is already out of date and will soon be obsolete.  The analogue classroom of old has been replaced with smartboards, internet connected devices and communication via instant message.  And rightly so.  Learning in the 21st century must revolve around technology in order to teach children the skills required for a digital life in a digital society. The challenges of the modern classroom have changed.  Ensuring that education is connected but that children aren’t involved in cyber bullying, sexting or exposed to online extremism is a daily challenge for schools and teachers alike.  Whilst the internet offers huge potential for learning the opportunity for distraction is never far away.  Simply making sure a class is focused becomes a different proposition when pupils can work on screens hidden from the teachers gaze.

Are They Still Watching? (2016),"Big Brother Watch present a timely report highlighting the competing tensions faced by local authorities when delivering public space video surveillance. The pressure on public services caused by austerity versus the future challenges of emerging technology are neatly addressed through analysis of recent spending patterns. Despite the reduction in spending highlighted in this report I am certain that new and advancing technologies will see further investment by local authorities to deliver new and exciting capabilities; from smart cities to smarter surveillance, the use of video analytics and algorithms to help protect its citizens from crime, support the night time economy and ensure free passage of traffic in our cities and towns. The sums of money involved are massive and it’s important that those charged with delivering this service get it right.My team is developing a process –a 'Passport to Compliance' –which will allow local authorities to follow an incremental and intelligent approach to considering whether a new surveillance camera system is essential. It begins with the question; “why do we want surveillance cameras and is there a legitimate and pressing need for them?” It will provide a framework and guidance schedule to ensure that every pound of public money spent on surveillance camera systems is spent wisely. It will ensure local authorities comply with the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice.

In1977  a  paper  entitledThe Right  Approach  to  the  Economy -Outline  of  an  Economic  Strategy  for  the  next Conservative  Government, authored  by  Conservative  grandeessuch  as  Geoffrey Howe and KeithJoseph, warned about legislation that “threatened personal liberty and the privacy of the family and home”1. Specifically they highlighted the powers of entry that were available to organisations such as Inland Revenue. More recently, Lord  Selsdon  and  Lord  Marlesford  have  both  attempted  to  legislate  for  greater restrictions on their use. Prior  to  the  election, the  Conservatives pledgedto  curb  the  disproportionate number  of these  powers.In  their  manifesto  they promisedto cut back “intrusive powers  of  entry.”2However,almost  four  years  later,there  remain  more  than  1,000 powers  that  allow  public  officials  to  enter  private property. Whilstthe  Protection  of Freedoms Act 2012 did begin the process of reform, with the Home Office leadinga Government-wide review, progress has been painfully slow.",https://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Powers-of-Entry-Report.pdf,Report,government,,,Research & Briefings,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NHS Data Breaches,"This report comes at crucial time for the NHS. With increasing amounts of our personal  data  and  information  being  held  by  the  health  service,  their  ability to store it securely and to ensure its safety is coming under growing scrutiny. NHS  Data  Breachesfollows our2011 report, NHS  Breaches  of  Data  Protection Law, which found that for the period July 2008 until July 2011 there were 806 breaches.2The 2014report continues where the last finished, with the findings indicating that far from improvingthe situation has worsened. It is because of this  that  we  are  calling  for  definitive  actionto  deter  such  data  breaches,including the introduction ofcustodial sentences.This  report  should  not  be  taken  as  suggesting  that  the  NHS  is  the  only organisation,  public  or  private,  that  needs  to  improve  with  regards  to  data protection.  Previous  Big  BrotherWatchreports,  such  as Local  Authority  Data Loss,have highlighted that the problem is far more widespread.3It is arguable however, that what is unique  to the NHS is  that the information held  about  patients  by  health  agencies  is  amongst  the  most  personal  and private information that it’s possible to record. If patients have any reason to think that their data isn’t safe within the NHS, then it could lead to a situation whereby  people  stop  reporting  symptoms  or  asking  for  the  necessary  help. This  is  state  of  affairs  that  must  be  avoided  at  all  costs.  For  these  reasons  it deserves special attention and this report should be seen as an urgent wake-up call to the NHS.",https://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NHS-Data-Breaches-Report.pdf,Report,government,,,Research & Briefings,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Off the record,"This  report  highlights  the  various  uses  of Regulation  of  Investigatory  Powers Act  2000by  police  forces  in  the  UK  in the  years 2010-2012.

Perhaps  more  than any  otherexample,our  work  on the  use  of  the Regulation  of  Investigatory  Powers  Act 2000 (RIPA)embodies both of these principles. Under RIPApublic authorities,such as local authorities and police forces,are permitted to use very intrusive methods of surveillance, for example bugging targets or the use of “covert human intelligence sources” (informers). Attempts  were  made  to  build  a  complete  picture  of  how  RIPA  powers  are being  used  by  police,  with  our Freedom  of  Information request  asking  for details of the use of ‘directed surveillance’, ‘covert human intelligence’and ‘intrusive surveillance’ (covert  surveillance  carried  out  in  residential  premises or  private  vehicles).

Traffic Spies,"Following   pledges   made   by   the   Conservatives   in   Opposition,   the   Coalition Agreement committed the Government to increase the regulation and oversight of CCTV  cameras. CCTV  should  only ever  be used in  exceptional circumstances,  and therefore  I  agreewith  the  government  that  local  authority  use  of  CCTV  for  parking enforcement should be banned.The  Protection  of  Freedoms  Act  2012  prepared  a  surveillance  camera  code  of practice,  which  sets  out  guidelines  for  CCTV  encouraging  transparency  in  their  use and   ensuring   public   bodies   consider   whether   they   are   proportionate   before erecting new cameras. The Act also created a new position of Surveillance Camera Commissioner, whose role it is to encourage all operators to comply with the code, review how the code is used in practice and provide advice and information about it.I  welcome  this  research  by  Big  Brother  Watch, which  highlights  that  despite  this guidance  and  additional  oversight,  local  authorities  are  continuing  to  use  CCTV cameras  for  means  other  than  public  safety.

Global attitudes to privacy online,"Our latest research looks at consumer attitudes towards online privacy, with the findings confounding presumptions that consumers – young or old – do not care about their privacy.

Undertaken by ComRes, it involved 10,354 interviews across nine countries (UK, Germany, France, Spain, India, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Australia) and the key findings were:

    Three quarters (79%) globally say they are concerned about their privacy online.
    Two-fifths (41%) of consumers surveyed globally say that consumers are being harmed by big companies gathering large amounts of personal data for internal use.
    Two out of three (65%) of consumers surveyed believe that national regulators should do more to force Google to comply with existing regulations concerning online privacy and the protection of personal data.

Online privacy is a global issue of real importance to people and the overwhelming message is that citizens do not feel their authorities are doing enough to the desire of large companies to collect vast amounts of data on them. You can read the full research below.

The widespread support for EU regulators to do more to ensure Google complies with existing privacy regulations highlights how people want to see real, concrete action taken to protect their privacy.",https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/all-work/global-attitudes-to-privacy-online/,Report,government,,,Research & Briefings,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Police use of ANPR,"The current Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) camera strategy was first fully rolled out in 2006. Since then there have been serious concerns raised about its privacy implications as well as its proportionality and scope. The number of cameras in the United Kingdom stands at 4368 and looks set to continue to rise. In 2005 Frank Whiteley, then Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Police andHead of the ANPR steering committee,said that the plan was to move from the “low thousands”1of cameras to the “high thousands”2. Financially there has been major investment in ANPR across the country, with forces spending a combined total of £22,495,444 in the past three years. We believe that the use of ANPR cameras should be subject to more rigorous oversight. Cases such as theso called“ring of steel” strategy inRoyston demonstrate that some forces can be over-zealous in their application of this technology. This can lead to huge invasions of privacy and to large numbers of completely innocent members of the public having every part of their journey’s tracked and recorded.

Private Investigators,"The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 introduced important safeguards in the use of surveillance powers by local authorities. The requirement of prior judicial authorisation is an important change in the law and one we wholeheartedly support. However, as this report highlights, the scope of public surveillance using private investigators risks undermining these protections.  Of particular concern is the number of cases where private investigators have been commissioned, yet their work deemed to not require RIPA authorisation, even in cases where the explanation provided appears to indicate surveillance was undertaken.The law in the UK, particularly the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, is broadly drawnto allow evidence to be introduced in court that inother jurisdictions would not be deemed admissible. Contrasted with the fruit of the poisonous tree provisions in the US, and broader protection offered by the Fourth Amendment, UK law risks failing to join up the evidential admissibility process and the regulation of surveillance.

Class of 1984,"The use of surveillance cameras in schools is perhaps one of the most sensitive uses of CCTV. From concerns about who is viewing the images to the broader question of acclimatising children to an environment where surveillance is the norm, it is not a topic to be taken lightly.Our research highlights how, as with local authorities, the use of CCTV varies massively from school to school. While of course local discretion is not a bad thing, the scale of variation does question how strategically CCTV is being used. Yet again CCTV appears to be used as a quick fix to much morecomplex problems and issues that simply cannot be solved with passive surveillance.  With some schools seeing a ratio of one camera for every five pupils, more than two hundred schools using CCTV in bathrooms and changing roomsand more cameras inside school buildings as outside, the picture across the country will undoubtedly shock and surprise many. To put into context the number of cameras, our research earlier this year found there are currently at least 51,600 CCTV cameras controlled by 428 local authorities. Indeed, one of the key questions that arises from this report is the oversight of schools by local authorities and how the situation has reached this level without any concerns being raised.

A legacy of suspicion,"Reflecting  pledges  made  by  Conservatives in  Opposition,  the  Coalition  Agreement committed   the   Government   to   ban   the   use   of   powers   in   the   Regulation   of Investigatory  Powers  Act  by  local  authorities,  unless  they  were  signed  off  by  a magistrate and required for stopping serious crime. The  Protection  of  Freedoms  Act  brings  this  into  law,  ensuring  the  public  can  be confident  that  overzealous  town  hall  bureaucrats  do  not  use  powers  intended  for terrorism  or  serious  criminal  investigations  for  trivial  issues.  Under  Labour,  councils seriously  abused  and  over-used  such  snooping  powers –for  matters  as  trivial  as spying  on  garden  centres  for  selling  pot  plants;  snooping  on  staff  for  using  work showers or monitoring shops for unlicensed parrots.I  welcome  this  research  by  Big  Brother  Watch,  highlighting  how  public  bodies  are hiding how they use RIPA and reminding us about the importance of monitoring how town halls may continue to use these powers under the new tougher laws.

DNA Database,"Despite the Protection of Freedoms Act, the retention of DNA in Englandand Wales remains an uncertain andilliberal regime.  The overwhelming majority of police forces are unable to distinguish the profiles of those convicted to those not charged, let alone found innocent. There is little to no standardisation between forces. Because of this, our research suggests the costof implementing the Protectionof Freedoms Actwill be double the Government’s own estimate, also casting serious doubt on the accuracy of the on-goingcosts of implementation. Whilstmaking good progress, the Protection of Freedoms Actdoes not fulfil the Coalition agreement’s pledge toimplement the Scottish model,with a broad discretionary power to retain DNA for ‘national security’purposes that was highlighted by the Joint Committee on Human Rights as a serious concern. Retention under this header will notbe authorised by judges. As recognised by the Information Commissioners Office, there remainsno provision for individuals to request the deletion of their DNA and fingerprints.

The Price of Privacy,"The Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) camera has become a ubiquitous feature on Britain’s streets.  Hanging  from  walls,  positioned  atop  lampposts,  and  hidden  behind  blacked-out glass;  cash-strapped  local  authorities  have  spent  unprecedented  amounts  of  taxpayers’ money  making  the  United  Kingdom  the  most  watched  nation  of  people  anywhere  in  the world.In  the  past  decade  alone,  the  number  of  CCTV  cameras  surveying  town  centre shopping precincts, parks and other public places has increased tenfold1.  There  are  currently  at  least 51,600CCTV  cameras  controlled  by  434local  authorities  in Britain, up from 21,000 in 19992.  This equates to 1 council owned CCTV camera for every 1200 people in the country.  This is a trebling of council-run surveillance and that is working off a high base –a little over a decade ago were already among the most watched peoples on earth and now local authorities spy on us three times as much.The most often quoted figure suggests that the average British citizen is captured on CCTV 300  times  a  day.   Whether this  is  accurate  or  not,  the  current  economic  climate  should demand  a reconsideration  of the  enormous  spending  on surveillance,  a criticalissue  which councils currently seem determined toignore. As  the  provision  of  CCTV  is  adiscretionary  service,  whichcouncils choose  to  provide,as opposed  to  a  non-discretionary  service  such  as  street-cleaning  or  rubbish  collection,  each CCTV camera puts an additional burden on the taxpayer.

Last  year,  Big Brother  Watch  reported  that  at  least  101,272  non-medical  personnel  had access to confidential medical records on file in the NHS.2Securing  patient  information  should  be  a  core  priority  for  the  NHS  and  as  this  research shows, not enough is being done to ensure patients’ privacy is protected.  This  problem  has  been  recognised  at  the  highest  levels.

Cataloguing the Innocent,"On 4th December 2008 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that keeping the DNA profiles of two men  from  Sheffield  -  who  had  previously been  cleared  of  criminal  charges  -  on  the  British  police  DNA database was a breach of   their human rights. Reacting to the court’s decision, Jacqui Smith - then Home Secretary - said that ""the existing law will remain in place while we carefully consider the judgement."" In the  Crime  and  Security  Bill,  the Government has  proposed  placing a  cap  of  6  years  on  the  retention  of  the DNA of innocent people if there is no further police interest in the person involved.Earlier this year the Conservatives released figures which exposed the massive discrepancy in how police forces  in  England  and  Wales  respond  to  requests  to  remove  DNA  profiles.  Although  there  are  an  estimated  one  million  innocent  people  on  the  national  DNA  database,  it  is  not  known  how  many  innocent  profiles  are  being  added  by  each  police  force  and  how  many  of  those  are  being  removed  without  being  prompted.  Cataloguing  the  Innocent  is  a  summary  of  our  efforts  to  collate  data  on  how  many  innocent  profiles  are  being  added  by  police  forces  in  the  UK  and  why  the  current  system  in usemakes  it  almost  impossible  for  England  and  Wales  to  comply  with  the  European  Court  ruling  requiring that they be removed.",https://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/cataloguingtheinnocent.pdf,Report,government,,,Research & Briefings,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any such proposals should be subjectto public consultation.We   call   on   Police   Scotland   to  immediately   remove   all   historic   images   ofunconvicted   people   from   the   Criminal   History   System   and   Police   NationalDatabase. We call   on the Scottish Parliament  to clarify the legal basis for thepolice’s taking and retention of images. We recommend that any Police Scotland or other public body’s use of post-eventfacial recognition analysis must be provided for by law, with proper statutorysafeguards and guidance including independent authorisation, a requirementfor any use to be proportionate and limited to a specific time period and athreshold for strict necessity with no other less intrusive means practicable.We call on Police Scotland to not use live facial recognition surveillance in publicplaces.",https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Big-Brother-Watch-and-Open-Rights-Group-Joint-Submission-to-the-Scottish-Justice-Sub-Committee-on-Policing-inquiry-into-Facial-Recognition-November-2019.pdf,legal document,government,,,Research & Briefings: Parliamentary Briefings & Evidence,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Right to Privacy & the Digital Revolution Inquiry – Written evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights,"A significant challenge to the right to privacy in the digital revolution in the UK comes fromstate mass surveillance, the rapid and experimental adoption of new technologies in policing,and automation in public services such as the welfare system.We recommend  that  formal   processes   are   instituted   whereby  public  authorities   seeking   toadopt   new   technologies   that   engage   rights   in   novel   ways   must   first   conduct   public   andparliamentary consultations.We believe that two important amendments are required to the Data Protection Act 2018.

today we are having our first hearing of this Congress on the use of facial recognition technology the Oversight Committee is uniquely suited to conduct a comprehensive review  of this issue because we have extremely wide-ranging jurisdiction we can look across all federal agencies state and local entities and the private sector as well I want to make clear at the on side that this is a bipartisan issue both the conservatives and liberals alike have real questions about when they are being monitored why they are being monitored 
who is monitoring them and what happens to this information after it is collected we've been working closely with the ranking member mr.

Facial recognition and the biometrics strategy – Briefing for the Westminster Hall debate (1 May 2019),"In this briefing, we examine one of the most pressing issues in the area of civil liberties andbiometrics in the UK - police forces’ use of live facial recognition surveillance technology. Wewelcome   the   opportunity   to   provide   briefing   ahead   of   this   debate   and   seek   to   informparliamentarians of the significant risks live facial recognition surveillance poses to humanrights and the rule of law in the UK.A   threat   to   freedom:   The   emergence   of   live   facial   recognition   surveillance   bypolice   in   England   and   Wales   poses  one   of   the   most   serious   threats   to   civilliberties   of   recent   years.   This   China-style   mass   surveillance   tool   risks   turningCCTV cameras into biometric checkpoints and citizens into walking ID cards.Incompatible with human rights: We explore the impact of live facial recognitionsurveillance   on   human   rights   in   the   UK   and   explain   why   such   biometriccheckpoints cannot be compatible with the rights framework.Discriminatory:  Furthermore, research has found that many live facial recognitionalgorithms   have   discriminatory   effect,   disproportionately   misidentifyingblack people and women.No law, policy or safeguards: Parliament has never passed a law enabling policeuse   of   facial   recognition   surveillance.   There   are   no   laws   and   no   safeguardsregulating this alarming expansion of surveillance in the UK. Ineffective:    Over   recent   years,   live   facial   recognition   has   proven   to   bedangerously   inaccurate,   producing   high   numbers   of   ‘false   positive’   matches.Police   have   accrued  thousands   of   false   positive   matches  of   members   of   thepublic whose photos have been subsequently taken and, for a period, stored.Over-policing:   Big   Brother   Watch   has   witnessed  innocent   members   of   thepublic   being   misidentified,   stopped   and   searched   –  including   a   14  year   oldblack boy in school uniform. We have also witnessed people being stopped andforced   to   show   identification, and in one case even  fined, for wearing hoodedjackets or having scarves covering their chins in winter weather. Secondly,   we   raise   the   issue   that  the   custody   image   database   contains   hundreds   ofthousands of innocent people’s images, likely unlawfully.",https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Big-Brother-Watch-briefing-on-Facial-recognition-and-the-biometric-strategy-for-Westminster-Hall-debate-1-May-2019.pdf,legal document,government,,,Research & Briefings: Parliamentary Briefings & Evidence,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Briefing for Short Debate on the use of Facial Recognition Technology in Security and Policing,"In this briefing, we focus on police forces’ use of automated facial recognition technology and seek to inform parliamentarians of the significant risks it poses to civil liberties and the rule of law in the UK. We seek to draw your attention to the facts: that there is no law, no oversight, and no policyregulating the police’s use of automated facial recognition. We also explain why automated facial recognition has proven to be an ineffective policing tool producing high numbers of ‘false positive’ matches. Furthermore, research has found that many automated facial recognition algorithms have discriminatory effect, disproportionately misidentifying black and female faces. Finally, we discuss the impact of automated facial recognition on human rightsinthe UK and question whether suchbiometric checkpoints are, or could ever be, compatible with the rights framework. Secondly, we raise the issue that the custody image database is oversized and is highly likely to retain images unlawfully. The antiquateddatabase of 21 million photos stores imagesof innocent people who neither received a conviction nor are of any policing interest. The storage of such photos was ruled unlawful in 2012 by the High Court in RMC and FJ v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and Secretary of State for the Home Department.

Algorithms in decision-making inquiry – Big Brother Watch’s written evidence to the Science and Technology Committee,"We have long warned against the adoption of Big Data analytics as the panacea to society’s woes. We have raised concern about bias, assumptionsand the potential for negative or restrictive conclusions being drawn,which could cause individuals harm. Algorithms, the toolsused to analyse big data,are clearly part of this concern. 2.Firstly,not all data is good data.Rather than encouraging “big data” analytics, we should be encouraging “relevant data”and “proportionate data”analytics, especially in the context of those made by or carried out in relation to Government and public bodies.3.Whilst some algorithms are designed to provide yes/no answers, increasingly that is not the sole purpose.   Indeed as we have seen from therecent “Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the UK”1paper published by the Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the push appears to be for algorithms to infiltrate and impact every corner of our data driven lives.  We feel profoundlynervous of such proposals and stress that caution is applied to the optimism of a perfect world which the paper tends to err towards.  4.Firstly human beings are nuanced.  There is no such thing as one size fits all in terms of people.  All legislative decisions will have positive and negative outcomes depending on how the law impacts the individual.  Whilst broad laws are necessary to help society to function, the role of using algorithms to offer precision to those laws is not necessarily going to provide better outcomes.

Implications of AI in the UK – Big Brother Watch’s written evidence to the Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence,"AI currently takes many  forms  including search  engines,  voice  recognition,  product  or  service recommendation  systems,  photographic  analysis  and  recognition,  targeted  advertising,  and  virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home.AI influences the products we purchase, the news we read, the adverts we seeand potentially who we vote  for. AI is also becoming crucial to the  functioning of the economy, being used to carry out trades, decide credit scores, and calculate and decide on financing and lending.Large  scale  datasets are  the  fuel  for  many,  if  not  all  AI  initiatives.  The large  scale acquisition, retention  and  use  ofbothindustrial  and  personal  data brings  privacy,  security  and  data  protection issues  to  the  fore.This  is  particularly  so  if  AI  is  to  be  used  to  simulate  human  decision-making,  at which point the very serious problems of biased and prejudiced AI must also be raised.",https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lords-Select-Committee-on-Artificial-Intelligence-Implications-of-AI-Submission.pdf,legal document,government,,,Research & Briefings: Parliamentary Briefings & Evidence,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data Protection Bill – Briefing,"The Data Protection Bill was published on the 13thSeptember 2017. Along with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the Data Protection Bill (DP Bill) is the biggest shake up of Data Protection law in the UK since 1998.In  the  UK  our  data  protection  laws currently rely on one  document  The  Data Protection  Act 1998. The Act is  a  reasonably  short  document  which  clearly  spells  out  right  from  the  start  what  a  person’s data protection rights are.The  new  dual  laws  of  the  GDPR  and  the  DP  Bill  are  welcome  in  that  they  expand  and  clarify  data protection for the 21stCentury, but  by introducing two separate pieces  of law there  is the opportunity for confusion for the public to know what their rights are, when they can be used and how.

Digital Economy Bill: Part 5 – Briefing: A few problems which need to be addressed,"Government’s poor history on data sharing and data security: Part 5 of the Bill will lead to greater data sharing across Government, despite a recent National Audit Office report1revealing that almost 9,000 data breaches across government departments occurred in 2014/15, only 14 were reported.The same report also revealed that the Cabinet Office conducted an internal review ofdata sharing across government which revealed that ‘government’s existing security structures and roles will not adequately support the next phases of our cyber security, workplace and digital strategies’. The strategy in Part 5 of the Bill is to improvethe “wellbeing” of all in society with emphasis on helping the most vulnerable.Over the weekend it was revealed thatdue to DWP failing to inform HMRC an estimated 28,000 families with children who qualify for disability living allowance missed out on additional tax credit2. This one example alone shows that ill-considered and poorly executed data sharing often makes the vulnerable even more so. It wasdetermined by the Supreme Court3earlier in the year that sharing personal information for the benefit of “wellbeing” failed to meet the high bar set by the Data Protection Act which says data use must be “vital”.",https://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/A-few-problems.pdf,legal document,government,,,Research & Briefings: Parliamentary Briefings & Evidence,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Renate Samson: No, they do not make very much sense, if I am honest. As I said, we were a member of the open policy making process and we also submitted to the consultation. I am genuinely surprised that after a two-year process, all of a sudden it felt very rushed. There were conversations and meetings happening right up to the Queen’s Speech; there was still a general lack of clarity, particularly on safeguards, and many questions were still being asked, such as how, why, when and so on. The next thing we knew, it was in the Queen’s Speech and the Bill was published.

Reading through part 5—and I have read through it a lot and scratched my head a great deal, mainly for the reasons given in evidence earlier today—you see that the codes of practice, which would explain an awful lot of what we imagine is meant or may not be meant, just have not been published. I have repeatedly asked for them and been given various expected dates, and we are sitting here today without them but with the Bill already having been laid before Parliament.

We have also done a lot of work on the Investigatory Powers Bill, for which the codes of practice were there right from the start. There was clarity as to what was intended and what was going to be legislated for, straight up. So, I am profoundly disappointed, because data sharing and digital government are hugely important and we seem to be very far away after a very long process.",https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/all-work/oral-evidence-to-parliament-digital-economy-bill/,legal document,government,,,Research & Briefings: Parliamentary Briefings & Evidence,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Written Evidence to the Public Bill Committee on the Digital Economy Bill,"The intention behind Part 5 of the Digital Economy Bill; to improve data sharing across Government, is something we support. A well established and well defined data sharing scheme for Government is essential not just for Government to function in a data driven society, but in order to enable better public services, benefit the vulnerable and needy in society and help with research and statistics; it will be a critical part of every citizen’s engagement with the State. Unfortunately Part 5 in its current form, we believe, will fail to establish a clear, well defined, efficient, principled and legal data sharing process.

Briefing on the Report of the Bulk Powers Review by David Anderson QC,"David Anderson’s report into the four bulk powers contained in the Investigatory Powers Bill was commissioned by the Government in response to calls from the Labour Party. The terms of reference were for Mr Anderson to “examine the operational case” for the bulk powers in Parts 6 and 7 of the Investigatory Powers Bill. Mr Anderson was not required, in his words, to “opine” on what safeguards would be appropriate or if the proposed safeguards in the Bill are proportionate. Mr Anderson was supported in his work by three team members.  Dr Bob Mowill a former Director of Technology and Engineering at GCHQ but now an independent security consultant, Gordon Meldrum former Director of Intelligence at the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Cathryn McGahey QC, barrister and QC in criminal and civil cases. The Report also presented 69 case studies where powers have been used or, in the case of bulk equipment interference, examples of how the power would be used. The report was published on the 10thAugust 2016.

In line with that, Big Brother Watch welcome the work which has been undertaken to ensure that the consumer is aware of the choices they have with regards to their energy data when using a smart meter.  However it is unfortunate thatsome companies are better than others at explainingto their customers theoptions available to them. Indeed some companies are not being completelyclear that a smart meter is an option and not a service the customer has to sign up to.  This is not acceptable.

Joint letter to the Scottish Justice Committee regarding the proposed Biometrics Commissioner,"We are writing as civil society organisations working across Scotland and the United Kingdom on issues of human rights and the impact of technologyon fundamentalrights.The use of biometrics in law enforcement is a well-established practice since the development of fingerprinting in the late 19thcentury. Biometrics now extends to but is not limited to DNA, facial search, gait, iris recognition, speech recognition, facial recognition. While useful in preventing, detecting and prosecuting crime, the capturing and storing and searching of biometric identifiers violates individual and group privacy. There is a need to ensure that the use of biometrics identifiers occurs within a governance framework that strikes a balance between public security and fundamental rights to privacy and data protection. It should also be acknowledged that other rights are engaged where this technology is used in public spaces, including the freedom of association and assembly, and freedom of expression.We are supportive of the Scottish Government’s legislation to create a Scottish Biometrics Commissioner. However, the scope of the Biometrics Commissioner is too narrow. Limiting the competencies of the regulator to law enforcement does not reflect the realities of the way biometrics are used in society.

Bias in Algorithmic Decision-Making (Crime and Justice) – Submission to the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation,"We   welcome   the   opportunity to   submit   evidence   to   the   Centre   for   Data   Ethics   and Innovation’sreview on bias in algorithmic decision-making.This  submission  will  focus  on  use  of  predictive  algorithms  in  both  policing  and  judicial decision-making.    New    technology    and    automated    systems,    encompassing    artificial intelligence, machine learningand big data analyticsare being used ever more widely in the criminal  justice  system.  These  are  being  used  to  predict  communities  to  target  with greater police  resources;  to  assess  individuals’risk  of  committing  crimes  in  the  future;  to  identify suspects in public places; and to supportpolice investigations.However,  these  new  systems  have  evidenced  some  extremely  concerning  biases.  There  are significant problems with the data being used to build and train these models, while some of those  building  the  models  have  shownlittle  regard  for  data  protection  or  human  rights.  This has  resulted  in  biased  and  discriminatory decisionsthat  are  in  large  part  automated,  with serious implications for the fairness of criminal justice. The protections afforded to individuals subject  to  these  biased,  unfair  or  unjust decisions  are  minimal.  Many  will  never  even  be aware they have been subject to such an automated decision.",https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Big-Brother-Watch-submission-to-the-Centre-for-Data-Ethics-and-Innovation-Bias-in-Algorithmic-Decision-Making-Crime-and-Justice-June-2019.pdf,letter,government,,,Research & Briefings: Submissions & Letters,,,,Big Brother Watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retention and Acquisition of Communications Data (IPA) – Consultation Response,"Big  Brother  Watch  welcomes  the  opportunity  to  provide  a  submission  on  this  important  topic. However, the  Government  is  long  overdue  in  amending  the  communications  data  regime following the CJEU’s clear finding. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) gave its judgment on 21 December 2016 on the joined cases Tele2 Sverige AB v Post-och telestyrelsen(Case C-203/15) and R (Watson) v Secretary of State for the Home Department(Case C-698/15) (“Watson”), specifying a number of  requirements  that  need  to  be  in  place  for  a Member  State’s data  retention  regime to  be compliant with EU law.The  Government has launched a public consultation on its proposed response to the CJEU’s ruling one year later, on 30th November 2017.

The Court was clear in Watson that the UK’s current communications data surveillance regime is unlawful in view of EU data protection laws and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Court ruled on two issues in relation to communicationsdata. The first element precludes the  general  and  indiscriminate  retention  of  communications  data.  The  second clarifies  that communications data may only be retained and accessed in relation to fighting serious crime, after  independent  authorisation  has  been  granted,  in  addition  to  other  safeguards.In  light  of the CJEU’s judgment, the UK’s regime urgently requires a serious overhaul.

Consultation on the Safe Use of Drones in the UK – Big Brother Watch Response,"In December 2015 Sky Newsreported that the number of public complaintsto the policeabout drones had risen by 2000%in three years1. Clearly this is an issue and law enforcement has tobe able to respond effectively. Key to helping the police deal with the risingnumber ofconcerns is the idea of registering drones. Without a workable system of registration for privately used drones it could be argued that very little progresscanbe made towards policing their use or making sure they are flown in a legal way. Registration is a process which needs to be given serious consideration sooner rather than later. The longer a system takes toimplement the more drones willneed to be registered retrospectivelyincreasingthe administrative burdens needed to make the system effective.Whilst speed is of the essence it shouldn’t be an excuse to cut corners. Whatever system is introduced has to inspire confidence in both members of the public and users, be sensible, easyto administerand easy to promote.

"The CNIL in a nutshell 2019 - PDF - 2,93 Mo",The CNIL supports the development of new technologies on a daily basis and takes part in the construction of a digital ethic.”,https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/the-cnil-in-a-nutshell.pdf,report,government,,,,,,,CNIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The CNIL's strategic roadmap 2019 - 2021,"2016, the CNIL adopted a three-year strategic and operational plan with two main goals. First to make the CNIL – which was faced with major quantitative and qualitative pressure due to far-reaching changes in a society entering the digital age – as an agile, comprehensive regulator   committed to joint regulation and inter-regulation. Secondly to create a project to cover an unprecedented period in the Commission’s history: the years in which the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted and came into force.   Three years later, the vision put forward has proved pertinent: thanks to the ongoing commitment of all its teams, the CNIL is extensively repositioned  and  modernised. The strategic plan enabled a better preparation to tackle its missions and carry them out to good effect over the course of 2018, a remarkable year due  to  the  switchover  to  a  new  legal  framework, a new, largely Europeanised mode of personal data governance, and a consequent considerable increase in referrals to the CNIL from private individuals and professionals alike.   Major steps have also been taken in 2019. The new legal framework is now in place and European cooperation has become a reality. Nonetheless, there is still some way to go to complete the transformation and to live by a fully disseminated “information technology and civil liberties” culture all over the country. It is in this context that, in March 2019, the CNIL committed to fresh orientations covering the period 2019-2021.

Following a phase marked by changes and transitions, this roadmap’scommon  thread is appropriation and  achievement, for one and all (private individuals,  professionals  and  the  European  collective  alike),of  all  the  GDPR’s  promises and  potentialitie s.  The  2019-2021 period will  be  decisive  in  lending credibility to the new legal framework and in making the ambitious European challenge an operational success. Civil society and economic players have high expectations. The new model helps raise awareness and lays the groundwork for designing regulatory frameworks across the world. In order to remain an efficient and down-to-earth data regulator in this new context and play its role to the full at national and European level alike, the CNIL must test out theories in practice and continue to modernise.

Roaming,"Roaming enables a mobile subscriber to automatically make and receive voice calls, send and receive data, or access other services when travelling outside the geographical coverage area of their home network, by means of using a visited network.

Roaming is technically supported by mobility management, authentication and billing procedures. Establishing roaming between network operators is based on – and the commercial terms are contained in – dedicated roaming agreements.

If the visited network is in the same country as the home network, this is known as national roaming. If the visited network is outside the home country, this is known as international roaming.

If the visited network operates on a different technical standard than the home network, this is known as inter-standard roaming.

GSM Roaming, which involves roaming between GSM networks, offers the mobile subscriber the convenience of being able to use a single number, a single bill and a single phone in up to 219 countries.

Credential Handler Polyfill,"A Credential Handler is an event handler for credential request and credential storage events. The Credential Handler API helps solve the Nascar Problem. The Credential Handler API enables websites to install Credential Handlers that can respond when users visit other websites that request or store credentials.

For example, a user may visit a website that wants them to login using OpenIdConnect, provide an OAuth Token, authenticate using a DID, or present some Verifiable Credentials. When these other websites use the Credential Handler API, the user is shown an in-browser selection screen with visual representations (e.g. icons and origin information) of only those Credential Handlers that they have been previously installed by the user and that are compatible with the website's request. Once the user makes a choice, the appropriate Credential Handler is loaded and a credential event is sent to it.

The Credential Handler receives the event via a Service Worker or, if the Credential Handler Polyfill is used, a simple page with no UI elements is loaded that uses the polyfill to receive and respond to the event.

The Credential Handler must respond to the event with a credential that fulfills the request. If necessary, the Credential Handler may open a window on its website's origin to allow the user to interact with its website prior to responding. This UI can be styled and shaped according to the website owner's brand using arbitrary JavaScript and HTML like any other webpage.

Multihash,"This specification describes a data model for expressing the output of cryptographic hash functions.

Cryptographic hash functions often have multiple output sizes and encodings. This variability makes it difficult for applications to examine a series of bytes and determine which hash function produced them. Multihash is a universal data format for encoding outputs from hash functions. It is useful to write applications that can simultaneously support different hash function outputs as well as upgrade their use of hashes over time; Multihash is intended to address these needs.",https://github.com/w3c-dvcg/multihash,specification,,,,Community Specifications,,,,Credentials Community Group,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hashlink,"When using a hyperlink to fetch a resource from the Internet, it is often useful to know if the resource has changed since the data was published. Cryptographic hashes, such as SHA-256, are often used to determine if published data has changed in unexpected ways. Due to the nature of most hyperlinks, the cryptographic hash is often published separately from the link itself.

This specification describes a data model and serialization formats for expressing cryptographically protected hyperlinks. The mechanisms described in the document enables a system to publish a hyperlink in a way that empowers a consuming application to determine if the resource associated with the hyperlink has changed in unexpected ways.

While mechanisms such as RFC6920, Resource Integrity Proofs and Magnet Links exist, they have a number of shortcomings such as implementation complexity, a focus on narrow use cases, and no clear extensibility or upgrade path.

This specification attempts to preserve the good parts of RFC6920, standardize the good parts of Magnet Links and Resource Integrity Proofs while ensuring that implementation complexity is kept to a minimum.

Base-encoding is often used when expressing binary data in hyperlinks, cryptographic keys in web pages, or security tokens in application software. There are a variety of base-encodings, such as base32, base58, and base64. It is not always possible to differentiate one base-encoding from another.

The Overwhelming Visibility of the Iran Plane Crash,"The media scholars **Britt Paris** and **Joan Donovan** have written about the ways that images have always had a more complicated relationship to the truth than it appears at first. Bits of media don’t have authority all on their own. They must acquire it through the context that surrounds them. — Alexis C. Madrigal, *The Atlantic*



To be alive in 2020 and connected to the immense information network is to experience a rich confusion of images, videos, social-media posts, and reportage about everything, all the time. The latest example: a Ukrainian-airliner crash outside Tehran. The plane, a Boeing 737-800, crashed shortly after takeoff yesterday, killing everyone aboard. There were unconfirmed rumors and general confusion and Twitter threads with videos, pictures, and analysis of what might have happened. (A missile? A malfunction?)

Beyond and next to the tragedy, it felt as if reality had melted and balled up together in one news story. The U.S. strike on an Iranian general last week had tilted the world toward a new precipice. Boeing’s problems with a different model of 737 have been global-headline news. And, of course, Ukraine is also at the center of geopolitics (not to mention American campaigns).

How could anyone know what had happened? The Ukrainians, Iranians, and Americans were all saying different things (not to mention the Canadians and the British).

That feeling of the complexity of this globe full of people has condensed into a common idea: Despite all the new information we have access to, we actually know less now. Maybe there has been or will be “an information apocalypse,” where technologically sophisticated fakes lead to a breakdown in general epistemological certainty about anything.

Deepfakes and Cheap Fakes,"In Deepfakes and Cheap Fakes, Data & Society Affiliates Britt Paris and Joan Donovan trace decades of audiovisual (AV) manipulation to demonstrate how evolving technologies aid consolidations of power in society. Deepfakes, they find, are no new threat to democracy.

Coining the term “cheap fakes,” Paris and Donovan demonstrate that the creation of successfully deceptive media has never necessarily required advanced processing technologies, such as today’s machine learning tools. A “deepfake” is a video that has been altered through some form of machine learning to “hybridize or generate human bodies and faces,” whereas a “cheap fake” is an AV manipulation created with cheaper, more accessible software (or, none at all). Cheap fakes can be rendered through Photoshop, lookalikes, re-contextualizing footage, speeding, or slowing.

Thanks to social media, both kinds of AV manipulation can now be spread at unprecedented speeds. For a spectrum diagram, click here.

“Nannies, elder care workers, and housecleaners might have years of experience, but that isn’t enough to thrive on a marketplace platform.”

By bringing these three types of platforms and workers together, this report complicates simple narratives about technology’s impact on labor markets and highlights the convergent and divergent challenges workers face when using labor platforms to find and carry out their work. Interviewees reported increased financial and personal risk due to platform policy and design loopholes. For example, workers with marginalized identities (e.g. people of color and undocumented workers; largely women) report inequitable conditions that arise from common features such as rating systems.
