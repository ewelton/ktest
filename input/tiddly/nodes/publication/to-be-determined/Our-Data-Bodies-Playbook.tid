Our Data Bodies (ODB) has conducted research and produced a workbook of popular education activities focused on data: surveillance: and community safety to co-create and share knowledge: analyses: and tools for data justice and data access for equity. We hope that our work will enhance trusted models of community health and safety and help illuminate the differences between being safe and being secure.
