In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

    Using welcoming and inclusive language
    Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
    Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
    Focusing on what is best for the community
    Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

    The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
    Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
    Public or private harassment
    Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
    Other conduct which co

    uld reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
