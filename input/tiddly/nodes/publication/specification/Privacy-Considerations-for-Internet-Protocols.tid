This document offers guidance for developing privacy considerations
   for inclusion in protocol specifications.  It aims to make designers,
   implementers, and users of Internet protocols aware of privacy-
   related design choices.  It suggests that whether any individual RFC
   warrants a specific privacy considerations section will depend on the
   document's content.
