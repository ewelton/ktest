The e-Government Core Vocabularies are simplified, re-usable and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of an entity, such as a person, a business, a location or a public service, in a context-neutral way. They can be used by public administrations to attain a minimum level of semantic interoperability for e-Government systems.

Core Vocabularies are simplified, re-usable and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. Public administrations can use and extend the Core Vocabularies in the following contexts:

Development of new systems: the Core Vocabularies can be used as a default starting point for designing the conceptual and logical data models in newly developed information systems.

Information exchange between systems: the Core Vocabularies can become the basis of a context-specific data model used to exchange data among existing information systems.

Data integration: the Core Vocabularies can be used to integrate data that comes from disparate data sources and create a data mesh-up.

Open data publishing: the Core Vocabularies can be used as the foundation of a common export format for data in base registries like cadastres, business registers and public service portals.
