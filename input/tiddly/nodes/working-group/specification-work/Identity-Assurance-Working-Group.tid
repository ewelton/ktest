The Identity Assurance Work Group (IAWG) has been formed within the Kantara Initiative to foster the adoption of trusted on-line identity services. To advance this goal, the IAWG will provide a forum for identifying and resolving obstacles to market and commercial acceptance that have limited broad deployment and adoption of trusted identity services thus far.
