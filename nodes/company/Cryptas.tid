Cryptas has many years of practical expertise in providing and implementing systems for protected electronic identities in large scale enterprise environments.

Cryptas develops and sells its own enabling technology to enhance strong authentication in large scale applications, but also partners with well-known industry members. Cryptas is purely focused on this topic and has been successful in business for over nine years.
