The purpose of this Working Group is to develop a meta-data document specification, APIs, and workflow to enable an administrator to federate an identity provider and a hosted application that supports one or more of OpenID Connect, SAML, and SCIM and enable configuration changes to be communicated between the identity provider and hosted application.
