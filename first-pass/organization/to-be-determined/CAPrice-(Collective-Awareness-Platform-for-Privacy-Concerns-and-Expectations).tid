Many of the devices (smartphones: smart TVs etc) and digital services (apps: web services etc) that are part of our everyday routine require access to our personal data in order to function. Often: these data are subsequently given to third parties and used for tracking and advertising purposes. Even though such practices are usually specified in the associated Terms and Conditions: these are complex legal documents that most people don’t actually read. We believe in a world where private data are protected from unjustified access and where people are truly aware of the privacy-related ramifications of using different devices or digital services. To realize this vision: we propose a crowdsourcing solution that will harness the power of the masses to improve the awareness of people on the content of Terms and Conditions: as well as to explicate the community’s related expectations: thereby exerting pressure on developers in supporting such expectations.
