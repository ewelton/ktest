Onlinecensorship.org seeks to encourage companies to operate with greater transparency and accountability toward their users as they make decisions that regulate speech. We offer resources: information on how to appeal different media platforms: and original research on what content is taken down: why companies make certain decisions about content: and how content takedowns are affecting communities around the world. Has your post: photo: status: video or tweet been blocked or deleted?
onlinecensorship.org gives social media users a place to report takedown notices and catalog content that has been removed. Simply follow our easy submission process to let us know how a platform has censored your content.
