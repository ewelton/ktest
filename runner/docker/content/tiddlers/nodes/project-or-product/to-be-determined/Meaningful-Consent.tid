Consent increasingly underpins our digital activities - it underpins the legal contracts we “agree” to when using Social Networking Services and is an important concept in the new European Data Protection regulations.

But often the consent we give is meaningless! We tick the box without knowing what it means: or click the button just to get rid of the message. This poses problems for individuals who aren't aware of their rights and obligations: and for organisations that rely on this meaningless consent as a legal protection.
