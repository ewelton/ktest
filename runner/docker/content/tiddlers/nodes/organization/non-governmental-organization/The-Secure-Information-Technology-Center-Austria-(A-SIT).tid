The Secure Information Technology Center – Austria (A-SIT) is a public funded non-profit association that has been established in 1999. Funding members have been the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Austria, and Graz University of Technology. In 2012 the Austrian Federal Computing Center joined as a member.
