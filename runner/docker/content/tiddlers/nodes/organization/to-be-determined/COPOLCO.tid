COPOLCO does not actually develop International Standards : it provides policy advice to the ISO. Founded in 1978: COPOLCO is the policy-making “ think tank ” on consumer matters for ISO: and reports directly to ISO Council: the executive governance body of ISO. ISO/COPOLCO’s mission is to promote and facilitate consumer input into ISO’s policy and technical work: and to help consumers around the world benefit from standardization.
