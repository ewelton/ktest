The Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability will continue to build and maintain the Guide in this electronic space as it develops as a tool: adding new modules and examples as well as ancillary materials to help raise awareness of its existence and usability.It is hoped that new synergies will form between data producers: publishers: users: and those providing capacity building and training. In this way: the guidance set out within the Guide can be incorporated into existing training materials and modules: and a consistent approach to the system-wide improvement of data interoperability can start to become a reality in the development sector.
