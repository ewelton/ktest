It is is a term coined by the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition which defines a replicable model for a multimedia: mobile neighborhood workshop fair. DiscoTechs are designed so that participants learn more about the impact and possibilities of technology within our communities.

DiscoTechs feature interactive: multimedia workshops designed to demystify: engage: and inform the community about issues of Internet use and ownership: and our communications rights on and offline.
