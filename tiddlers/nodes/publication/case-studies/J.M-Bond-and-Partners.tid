Coelition will give us all peace of mind when using internet-connected products.

J.M Bond & Partners is a hypothetical trusted department store with a strong home electrical offering. Their customers rely on them for low-jargon access to the latest technologies.

Their Smart Home Programme allows ordinary consumers to make use of the benefits of emerging internet-connected products without needing technical skills or worrying about security (hacking of the home through appliances).

The programme extends the J.M Bond & Partners brand into the home where it can provide additional, valued services based on their unique understanding of the individualâ€™s use of products - from energy saving to home security or seasonal offers.
