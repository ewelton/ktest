The  hopes  and  fears  sparked  by  artificial  intelligence today  have  raised  it  to  mythological  status  in  many imaginaries and narratives. Some foresee the massive destruction of our jobs, the apocalyptic emergence of a hostile robotic consciousness or the downfall of Europe, called to get overwhelmed by the global competition. Others, meanwhile, are being pinned on the dream of a tailor-made world, a new Golden Age where every thankless or repetitive task would be  delegated  to  machines;  an  Eden  where  infallible  tools would have put an end to illness and crime, and perhaps even political conflict; in short, evil would have become a thing of the past. Under its myriad guises that are, by turn, fascinating or alarming, bright or gloomy, AI arguably says more about our fantasies and fears than about what our future world will look like. The appeal of this type of eschatological rhetoric in Europe is such that it shows to what extent technology allows visions of the future and generates a power to look ahead, which is sometimes lacking from our political visions.
