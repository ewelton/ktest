These guidelines provide practical guidance and interpretative assistancefrom the Article 29 Working Party (WP29)onthe new obligation of transparency concerning the processing of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation1(the “GDPR”). Transparency is an overarching obligation under the GDPR applying to three central areas: (1) the provision of   information   to   data   subjects   related   to   fair   processing;   (2)   how   data   controllers communicate with data subjects in relation to their rights under the GDPR; and (3) how data controllers facilitate the exercise by data subjects of their rights2. Insofar as compliance with transparency is required in relation to data processing under Directive (EU) 2016/6803, these guidelines  also  apply  to  the  interpretation  of  that  principle.4These  guidelinesare,  like  all WP29 guidelines, intended to be generallyapplicable and relevantto controllersirrespective of the sectoral, industry or regulatory specifications particularto any given data controller. Assuch,these guidelines cannot address the nuances and many variables which may arise in the  context  of  the  transparency obligations of  a specificsector, industry or  regulated area. However,these guidelines are intended to enable controllers to understand,at a high level, WP29’s interpretation of what the transparency obligations entail in practice andto indicatethe  approach  which  WP29  considers  controllers  should  take to  being  transparent  while embedding fairnessand accountability into theirtransparency measures.
