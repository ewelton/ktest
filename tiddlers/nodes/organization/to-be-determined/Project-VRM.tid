ProjectVRM is a development and research project of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. It has two purposes:

    To encourage development of tools by which individuals can take control of their relationships with organizations — especially in commercial marketplaces.
    To encourage and conduct research on VRM-related theories, usage of VRM tools, and effects as adoption of VRM tools takes place.

The project was created by Doc Searls when he became a fellow at the Center in 2006. Since then it has grown to play a driving role in many different development categories. (A partial and ever-changing list of those, and their occupants, is here.)

VRM stands for Vendor Relationship Management, the customer-side counterpart of Customer Relationship Management, the $48 billion business by which companies attempt to relate to customers (for example through call centers).
