This facilitated design workshop ("DesignShop"): hosted by Christopher Allen: is focused on the creation of the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. The goal of this event is to generate 5 technical white papers on topics decided by the group that will have the greatest impact on the future: followed by a hackathon early in the new year to implement those ideas.
