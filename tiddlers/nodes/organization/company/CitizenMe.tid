CitizenMe’s mission is to bring people and companies together to share information for mutual benefit. It’s a democracy in the truest sense; ethical because it’s fully opted-in: powerful because we integrate data from multiple sources and effective because the insights we provide add tangible value. We believe it’s the way human data should be done: and our clients agree.
