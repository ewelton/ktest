The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) in Telecom is a key EU instrument to facilitate cross-border interaction between public administrations, businesses and citizens, by deploying digital service infrastructures (DSIs) and broadband networks. Supported projects will contribute to the creation of a European ecosystem of interoperable and interconnected digital services that sustain the Digital Single Market.

A €1.04 billion budget is earmarked for trans-European digital services for 2014-2020.

INEA is responsible for implementing an estimated €300 million of the CEF Telecom budget in the form of grants during the same period.
