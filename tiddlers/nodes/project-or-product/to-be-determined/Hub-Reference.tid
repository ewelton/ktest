This repo contains an open source implementation of a DIF identity hub for evaluation purposes. It is not intended for production use. The APIs and protocols used throughout are part of a proposed standard for decentralized data storage.

Identity hubs provide durable storage for information and data "owned" by a decentralized identity (DID). Hubs can run in multiple different enviornments - in the cloud, on a server, or on an edge device. All instances of identity hubs that are associated with a DID synchronize data between each other to ensure consistency. Currently, identity hubs support simple read and write of JSON data.
