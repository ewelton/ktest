Technologists have power and can build things used for tremendous good. But when abused, technology can also cause massive harm. Does the product you’re building have the ability to unfairly target communities of color, endanger families seeking asylum, or expose survivors of abuse? We need tech workers to remain vigilant and speak out about the projects they are working on and those project’s impact.
