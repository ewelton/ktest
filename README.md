# Executive Summary

1. Achievements
  1. Integration of existing data sources

    1. Me2B Alliance (Working sheets)
    1. Kumu (Original IDCommons)
    1. Research Assistant (infominer)
    1. Korsimro (Filler data)
    1. Becker (on deck)

  2. Ontology + Data Input

    Ontology created, tested, and tuned.  Significant effort put into checking and cleaning up data and determining tweaks to ontology.  Multiple iterations
    to adjust term sets and deal w/ missing or incorrect
    data

  3. Data Triage + Data Mgmt pathway (infominer)
  4. PoC testing of pathway components


2. On Deck for EOY (demo next meeting)
  1. Community Edit Access (via github acct)
  2. Preliminary maps
  3. Drop-link-to-report
  4. Final Hosting Determination

3. Challenges
  1. Startup ran into holidays
  2. Client/Server avoidance
  3. Data sparsity

# Alliance UX Goal

1. Services by .orgs that relate to privacy needs of end users
2. Products by .orgs that relate to privacy needs of end users
3. Understanding Me2B connection to other organizations
4. Understanding Products and Services

    This will have several maps to help understand the different products and services avaliable for different purposes. It will look at the various products along with different purposes.

5. Scope Capture

    Understanding the range of activities organizations are working on relative to particular aspects of promoting digital privacy dignity and empowerment

6. Institutional Focus

  * Certification
  * Terms of Service
  * Legal
  * Privacy Rights
  * Legal Duties of businesses
  * Individual privacy rights
  * FIPs
  * FIPPS
  * Data use permissions
  * Privacy usability
  * Security privacy ux  dissonance
  * Data right to use
  * Reverse eula
  * SSI usability

7. Harm/Response focus

  became clear that there is a relationship between individual harms/violations listed in the dictionary and organizations working on those harms.  For instance, Me2B will *not* be covering all of the harms listed in the dictionary.  Good examples are that the Center for Humane Society is covering some of the bigger more individual-behavioral type harms, and Kathryn Harrison’s “Deep Trust Alliance” is working on Deep Fakes, for example.  So we’d want to indicate in the Harms Dictionary for each entry which orgs are working on mitigating those harms.  (Possibly.)


# Architectural Goal

Construction of a community resource that does not require client/server and is not bound to a specific platform.  

1. Wiki Capability w/o Client/Server Model
2. Multiple paths of access
3. Audit Control



# Milestones

1. Data merged and normalized from multiple sources
  1. Me2B Alliance (Working sheets)
  1. Kumu (Original IDCommons)
  1. Research Assistant (infominer)
  1. Korsimro (Filler data)
  1. Becker (on deck)

1. Ontology & Cleanup

# Maps under development

## Services by .orgs that relate to privacy needs of end users
This map starts with products/projects subtype service that are created by organizations subtype NGO ()

## Products by .orgs that relate to privacy needs of end users
This map starts with teh projects/products - subtype Products that are created by organizations sub-type NGO.  (an example here should be Privacy Badger by EFF)



## Understanding Me2B connection to other organizations

This map starts with the column Me2B Relationship and then pulls in all the organizations listed as these types.

* member
* affiliates
* funder
* potential collaborator

Maybe a map for each...type - these maps could then also leverage the differnet fields of each of the organization to reflect if they are research labs, companies, ngos - and perhaps also draw on data about the various activities they are doing  

_We don't have a field that captures this yet - what Me2B Alliance gives to and what it receives_



## Understanding Products and Services

This will have several maps to help understand the different products and services avaliable for different purposes. It will look at the various products along with different purposes.


## Understanding the range of activities organizations are working on relative to particular aspects of promoting digital privacy dignity and empowerment

Differnet organizations are oriented to differnet types purposes and activities. These maps map will draw on various activities/purposes - it may draw on fields like location to see pockets of activity around the world.









Trustable Technology enabler organizations are currently defined as follows but these should be vetted and validated in developing the final ontology:

* Movements (Education, PR, Awareness)
* Standards Bodies
* Open Source Implementations
* Consumer  Organizations
* Trade Organizations
* Certifications
* Policy & Regulatory
* Thinktanks
* Academic & Research


## From LISA's e-mails

would be good to be able to filter on “Organization Principles”.  This seems hard and maybe not possible, but as I clarify how Me2B has a slightly different orientation than other orgs, it’s important to understand the “venn diagram” of how orgs share and differentiate based on principles

biomedical and patient rights type orgs


I’d like to start creating a list of reailstic search requests we might actually be interested in (and I will even reach out to the Me2B community and maybe VRM list).  Here are some for me—please add yours:

Which organizations are working on:

* Certification
* Terms of Service
* Legal
* Privacy Rights
* Legal Duties of businesses
* Individual privacy rights
* FIPs
* FIPPS
* Data use permissions
* Privacy usability
* Security privacy ux  dissonance
* Data right to use
* Reverse eula
* SSI usability
