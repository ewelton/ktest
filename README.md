# Introductory Narrative

This website will appear under a domain (to be provided).  It contains the
text prose and story that serves to introduce the project, its capabilities,
and guides users to help find answers to common questions.

This is a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site, which is
automatically built from a git [Repository](https://github.com/ewelton/ktest/tree/gh-pages)
using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to transform
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) into
a static HTML site.

We have the ability to embed assorted search forms within this static site, and
we will make canned downloadable  reports from the wiki easily available.

We can think of this as a front end to the [core wiki](wiki.html).  The wiki
will be editable within the wiki itself upon release (direct saving is
currently disabled).  The data is also editable via standard git mechanisms,
but also via [Prose](https://prose.io/#ewelton/ktest/tree/gh-pages/tiddlers/nodes).

Publication of changes to GitHub triggers a regeneration of the site, which
automatically updates all reports, search indices, and content using
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

# Narratives in the process of being built.

These are topics we will be addressing through a combination of prose,
prepared graphical maps and reports, and focused searches.

1. Services by .orgs that relate to privacy needs of end users
2. Products by .orgs that relate to privacy needs of end users
3. Understanding Me2B connection to other organizations
4. Understanding Products and Services

    This will have several maps to help understand the different products and services avaliable for different purposes. It will look at the various products along with different purposes.

5. Scope Capture

    Understanding the range of activities organizations are working on relative to particular aspects of promoting digital privacy dignity and empowerment

6. Institutional Focus

  * Certification
  * Terms of Service
  * Legal
  * Privacy Rights
  * Legal Duties of businesses
  * Individual privacy rights
  * FIPs
  * FIPPS
  * Data use permissions
  * Privacy usability
  * Security privacy ux  dissonance
  * Data right to use
  * Reverse eula
  * SSI usability

7. Harm/Response focus

  became clear that there is a relationship between individual harms/violations listed in the dictionary and organizations working on those harms.  For instance, Me2B will *not* be covering all of the harms listed in the dictionary.  Good examples are that the Center for Humane Society is covering some of the bigger more individual-behavioral type harms, and Kathryn Harrison’s “Deep Trust Alliance” is working on Deep Fakes, for example.  So we’d want to indicate in the Harms Dictionary for each entry which orgs are working on mitigating those harms.  (Possibly.)
