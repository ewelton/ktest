CAPrice (Collective Awareness Platform for Privacy Concerns and Expectations),Many of the devices (smartphones: smart TVs etc) and digital services (apps: web services etc) that are part of our everyday routine require access to our personal data in order to function. Often: these data are subsequently given to third parties and used for tracking and advertising purposes. Even though such practices are usually specified in the associated Terms and Conditions: these are complex legal documents that most people don’t actually read. We believe in a world where private data are protected from unjustified access and where people are truly aware of the privacy-related ramifications of using different devices or digital services. To realize this vision: we propose a crowdsourcing solution that will harness the power of the masses to improve the awareness of people on the content of Terms and Conditions: as well as to explicate the community’s related expectations: thereby exerting pressure on developers in supporting such expectations.,https://www.caprice-community.net/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ethical Source Movement,In recognition of this reality: there is a growing demand from open source developers to take control of how our software is being used. We don’t want our code used to aid those who commit human rights violations or other unethical behavior. We don’t want our software used to support fascist states. We don’t want our labor and our code used to enable global corporations to unfairly generate huge profits off the workers of the world. Yet we lack the tools to enforce fair: ethical: and community-minded terms for those who benefit from our work.,https://ethicalsource.dev/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Open Data Commons,Open Data Commons is the home of a set of legal tools to help you provide and use Open Data,https://opendatacommons.org/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Datacommons.org,"Publicly available data from open sources (census.gov: NOAA: data.gov: etc.) are vital resources for students and researchers in a variety of disciplines. Unfortunately: processing these datasets is often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying datasets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities (city: county: etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.

Data Commons attempts to synthesize a single ""Open Knowledge Graph"" (OKG) from these different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such as cities: counties: organizations: etc.) across different datasets to nodes on the graph: so that users can access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. Like the Web: the Data Commons OKG is open - any user can contribute datasets or build applications powered by the graph. In the long term: we hope the data contained within the Data Commons OKG will be useful to students: researchers: and enthusiasts across different disciplines. Though we've ""jump-started"" the graph with data from publicly available sources (CDC: US Census: FBI: etc.): we encourage you to join and contribute.

You can use the Data Commons Graph Browser to browse the graph. The data can be programmatically accessed via APIs. For example usage: check out the tutorials.

Data Commons is a project started by Google: and is intended to be a community effort. Get involved!",https://www.datacommons.org/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
